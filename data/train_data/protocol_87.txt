Adsorbing Viruses on TEM Grids
On the same day as grid prep, use glow discharge to render grids hydrophylic.
Holding the grid in the tweezers, place 5 µl of viral lysate onto the shiny side of the grid (Figure 1).
Let the sample sit for ~3 minutes to allow the viruses to adsorb to the grid.
Stain the viruses using the protocol “Positive and Negative Staining of Viruses on TEM Grids”.
