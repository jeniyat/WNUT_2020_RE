Lowry Protein Assay
Set up a standard curve of 0, 10, 25, 50, 100, 150 and 200 µg of BSA in 10-15 ml tubes, 1.0 mL volume per sample.
Set up tubes (10-15 mL) of the unknown protein sample(s) to determine their concentration, the final volume per sample is to be 1.0 mL.
Add 5.0 mL of reagent “C” to each tube, mix immediately.
Let the samples sit for 10 min at room temperature.
Add 0.5 mL of reagent “D” to each tube, mix immediately.
Let the samples sit for 30 min at room temperature.
Read absorbance at 600 nm.
Record values, plot standard curve and determine sample concentration(s).
