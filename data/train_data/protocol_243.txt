Qiagen QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit (27104 or 27106) with a microcentrifuge
Resuspend pelleted bacterial cells in 250μl Buffer P1 and transfer to a micro-centrifuge tube.
Add 250 μl Buffer P2 and mix thoroughly by inverting the tube 4–6 times.
Add 350 μl Buffer N3 and mix immediately and thoroughly by inverting the tube 4–6 times.
Centrifuge for 10 min at 13,000 rpm (~17,900 x g) in a table-top microcentrifuge.
Apply the supernatants from step 4 to the QIAprep spin column by decanting or pipetting.
Centrifuge for 30–60 s. 
Discard the flow-through.
Wash the QIAprep spin column by adding 0.5 ml Buffer PB and centrifuging for 30–60 s. 
Discard the flow-through.
Wash QIAprep spin column by adding 0.75 ml Buffer PE and centrifuging for 30–60 s. 
Discard the flow-through, and centrifuge at full speed for an additional 1 min to remove residual wash buffer. 
Place the QIAprep column in a clean 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube.
Centrifuge for 1 min.
Let stand 1 minute. 
Add 50 μl buffer EB or water to the center of each QIAprep spin column. 
Centrifuge 1-5mL bacterial overnight culture at >6800g for 3 minutes at room temperature.
