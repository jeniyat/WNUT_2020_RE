Seydoux lab Cas9 preparation test: 
Tag gtbp‐1 with eGFP or mCherry using dpy‐10 co‐CRISPR. 
Prepare the repair PCR template as indicated in Reagents for gtbp‐1 eGFP and mCherry tagging (see guidelines) and Repair template synthesis.
Make the injection mix as indicated in injection mixes, part I.
Use the crRNA gtbp‐1 Ct (#728 in Table S3).
Inject 15‐20 young adult N2 worms and recover as described in Worm recovery and handling.
Pool the recovered worms (P0s) on one plate and incubate for 22‐23h at 20 °C (day 1).
Clone the P0s to individual OP50 plates and incubate at 20 °C for 4‐5 days (day 2).
When the F1s reach the adult stage, check for Rollers.
From those “jackpot broods”, screen the Rollers for fluorescent protein expression as described in Screening for edit of interest.
