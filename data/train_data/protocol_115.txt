Gel Electrophoresis
Pour 50 mL of 1X TAE Buffer into an Erlenmeyer Flask.
Weigh out 0.5 g Agarose and add it to the Erlenmeyer Flask.
Place Erlenmeyer Flask in a microwave on high power for two minutes or until solution is clear and agarose is completely dissolved.
Remove Erlenmeyer Flask from microwave and let it sit on the lab bench to cool just until you can comfortably pick it up.
Add 5 uL Ethidium into the flask and swirl to mix, taking care not to introduce bubbles.
Place gel tray on clamp and clamp securely.
Add well plates where you want wells and use a level to ensure it is balanced.
Pour contents of the Erlemeyer Flask into the gel tray and let it sit for 30 minutes, or until a blue tint appears.
Remove the well plates carefully as to not tear the gel and remove the tray from the clamp, but ensure the gel remains in the tray.
Place gel tray into gel electrophoresis apparatus with the wells closer to the negative/black end.
Pour additional TAE Buffer to fill each side of the apparatus and to create a thin layer of buffer covering the top of the gel.
Pipette 10 uL of the 1kb DNA Ladder with Loading Dye into a well.
Typically this is placed into one of the wells near an edge.
Pipette your DNA with Loading Dye mixture into another well.
Repeat for each sample.
Place lid on apparatus and plug cables into amplifier.
Set amplifier to stay at a constant voltage of 100 V. Let run for 30 minutes or until the loading dye has sufficiently moved.
Remove gel from gel tray after draining excess TAE Buffer and place on plastic wrap.
Place gel with plastic wrap on UV lamp to view bands, or store in the plastic wrap at +4 C for later use.
