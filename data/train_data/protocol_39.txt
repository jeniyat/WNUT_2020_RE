Induction of Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase recombinant protein
Inoculate E. coli BL21 strain containing the recombinant protein of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase in 5mL LB liquid medium (containing 100ug/mL ampicillin), 37 ℃ shaking and culture overnight.
Transfer 1mL overnight cultures in 100 mL (containing 100ug/mL ampicillin) LB liquid medium; 37 ℃ shake culture until OD600 = 0.6 - 0.8.
Take 10ul samples for SDS-PAGE analysis.
Add IPTG to a final concentration of 0.5 mmol/l, culture 1-3h at 37 ℃.
12,000rpm centrifugation for 10 min, discard the supernatant; store cell precipitate at -20 ℃ or -70 ℃.
