Modified KAPA Express Extract
Incubate in a thermocycler for 10 minutes at 75ºC.
During this step, cells are lysed, nucleases and proteins degraded and DNA released.
Incubate for 5 minutes at 95ºC to inactivate the thermostable KAPA Express Extract protease.
Vortex reaction product for 2-3 sec.
Centrifuge at high speed for 1 minute to pellet debris.Transfer DNA-containing supernatant to a fresh tube.
Use 1 μl of DNA extract directly in a 25 μl PCR, without quantification.
Dilute in TE Buffer for long-term storage at -20ºC.
