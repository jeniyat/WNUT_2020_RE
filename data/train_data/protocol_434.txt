T-maze phototaxis with LEDs
Clip wings of half of the flies.
Let flies recover for 1 day (at 25°C, faster recovery).
Put the flies in the T-maze (entrance tube) and let them adapt themselves to the machine and the darkness for 10 minutes.
Move the flies into the elevator (the mobile part of the T-maze), and let them stay there for around 1 minute.
Move the flies to the bottom of T-maze (taking down the elevator).
Now they will have to make a decision between two different tubes: one is completely dark, and the other one has a LED in the bottom/is entirely transparent.
We are going to use different LEDs: White LEDs, Yellow LEDs, Green LEDs. 
Wait for 30 seconds for the flies to make their decision, and lock them in the tubes that they have chosen (taking up the elevator).
Anesthetize the flies with CO2 and count them under the magnifying glass.
