Phenol extraction of Chlorella cells
Pellet cells (~1/2 daily culture).
Suspend in 15 ml of liquid phenol.
Add about 0.2ml 5% cetylpyridium chloride (cationic detergent) to facilitate chlorophyll extraction.
Shake suspension until green has been extracted from cells.
Add 10 ml toluene (to reduce density).
Mix.
Centrifuge and wash pellet with aqueous buffer.
Wash pellet about 5x.
Use your nose as a guide to removal of phenol.
If need be a UV spectrum of the final wash supernatant can be used to assure absence of phenol.
