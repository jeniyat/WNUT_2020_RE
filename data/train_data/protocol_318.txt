DNA Extraction from sorted cells
Prepare 2x lysis buffer and add to the volume of sample so that its final concentration is 1x.
Filter-sterilize through 0.2 μm.
Prepare 2x Lysis buffer with Lysozyme & RNase (1): right before use add to 1 ml aliquot of lysis buffer: 
Shake to dissolve thoroughly, then filter-sterilize again.
Dilute the 2x lysis buffer 1:1 with MQ water.
Weigh out minimum amount of ProtK, then add the appropriate amount of lysis buffer.
Filter sterilize again.
Add 1 volume of 2x Lysis buffer with Lysozyme & RNase to 1 volume of sorted cells.
Note down volumes and resulting volume V1.
Incubate at 37°C for 30 min, rotating end-over-end at angle (OR: in the shaking incubator @ 100 rpm, vertical), for optimal mixing with minimal frothing; alternatively, shake vertically @ 100 rpm on shaking incubator and invert 10 times every 10 min.
Add V1*0.07 μl of ProtK lysis buffer (2) to a final concentration of 0.65 mg/ml.
Note down volumes, including resulting volume V2.
Add V2/9 μl of 10% SDS to a final concentration of 1%.
Note down volumes.
Incubate at 55°C for 2 hours, rotating end-over-end at angle (OR: in the shaking incubator @ 100 rpm, vertical; invert every 20 min 10 times). 
Add 600 μl buffer AL (= buffer without the EtOH). 
Mix thoroughly by vortexing. 
Incubate at 70°C for 10 min (for heat block use 1.5 ml tubes!)
Add 600 μl of 96-100% EtOH Mix by vortexing vigorously. 
Check pH of lysate, must be <7 to get max. binding efficiency. 
Pipette max. possible volume onto spin columns. 
Spin 3 min at 8000xg; discard flow-through. 
Pipette additional lysate onto spin columns. 
Spin 1 min at 8000xg; discard flow-through and collection tube, transfer column to new collection tube. 
Add 500 μl of buffer  
AW1 Spin 2 min at 8000xg; discard flow-through. 
Add 500 μl of buffer. 
AW2 Spin 3 min at 8000xg; discard flow-through and collection tube, To dry columns, spin at 8000xg for 3 min. 
Discard potential flow-through; transfer column to new collection tube. 
Add 200 μl pre-heated 70°C buffer AE or water. 
Incubate 1 min at room temp.
Spin at 8000xg for 2 min to elute. 
Repeat with second 200 μl.
Transfer eluted DNA to the Amicon Ultra 30 K. 
Centrifuge at 10,000xg for 10 min. 
Rinse DNA with 500 μl PCR water. 
Centrifuge at 10,000xg for 10 min. 
Add 20 μl dilute TE, pipette up and down 20 times and transfer to clean tube for storage. 
Centrifuge at 1000xg for 3 min upside down, in fresh tube to retrieve (Optional: repeat with another 20 μl to ensure all retrieved)
