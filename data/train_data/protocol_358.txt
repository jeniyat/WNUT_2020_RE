Monitoring fluorescence during cyanobacterial physiology/lysis experiments
Advance Preparation: Aliquot 180 µl seawater medium (e.g. ASW) into each well of a 96-well plate.
Keep a log of your plate layout (which samples in which wells).
Plate-Setup: Add 20 µl of sample into the ASW for a 10X dilution.
Mix well with a pipette.
Read fluorescence using the Tecan Infinite Pro 200M plate reader.
Set up a program using the following wavelengths: excitation 440 nm, emission 680 nm for chlorophyll a;  excitation 544 nm, emission 577 nm for phycoerythrin.
Plot fluorescence vs. time to track the real-time progression of cell growth and/or phage infection.
