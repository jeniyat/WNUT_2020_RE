Preparation of NC64A “Ghosts”
Centrifuge the NC64A chlorella in the Sorvall centrifuge at 5,000 rpm, 5 min, 4°C if fresh cells are used.
If frozen cells are used, thaw the pellets and suspend with 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8.
Centrifuge the cells in the Sorvall SS34 rotor or HB-4 rotor at 5,000 rpm, 5 min, 4°C.
Decant the supernatants.
Centrifuge the cells in the Sorvall SS34 rotor or HB-4 rotor at 5,000 rpm, 5 min, 4°C.
Repeat the 70% methanol washes 5-6 times or until the desired amount of pigment has been removed from the cells.
Store the chlorella “ghosts” at 4°C in 70% methanol.
Add 10-15 mL of 70% methanol to the chlorella pellets and resuspend the cells completely.
Decant the supernatants.
