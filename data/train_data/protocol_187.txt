Genomic DNA extraction from mosquitoes
Freeze mosquitoes and separate 1 mosquito per tube.
Add 25 uL of fly grinding buffer.
Grind mosquitoes with a pestle.
Rinse pestle with 25 uL of buffer.
Incubate at 65o C for 30 min. 
Add 7uL 8M KAc. 
Incubate at ice for 30 min. 
Centrifuge at max speed for 15 min at RT. 
Collect supernatant and add 0.7 vol (28 uL over 40 uL) of room temperature of isopropanol (or 1 vol of ice cold 100% EtOH) and incubate for 5 min at room temperature.
Centrifuge at RT for 15 min at max speed.
Discard supernatant and add 100 uL 70% EtOH.
Centrifuge for 5min at max speed at RT.
Discard supernatant and add 100 uL 100% EtOH.
Centrifuge for 5 min at max speed at RT.
Discard supernatant and aird dry at RT for 1 hour. 
Resuspend in TE, heat for 10 minutes and quantify with nanodrop
