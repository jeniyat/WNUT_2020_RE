High Efficiency Transformation Protocol (modified)
Warm SOC media to room temperature. 
Thaw a tube of NEB 5-alpha Competent E. coli cells on ice for 10 minutes.
Aliquot 25uL of the cells into a new tube. 
Add 0.5-2.5 µl containing 0.5 pg-50 ng of plasmid DNA to each cell mixture.
Carefully flick the tube 4-5 times to mix cells and DNA.
Do not vortex.
Place the mixture on ice for 30 minutes.
Do not mix.
Heat shock at exactly 42°C for exactly 30 seconds.
Do not mix.
Place on ice for 5 minutes.
Do not mix.
Pipette 475 µl of room temperature SOC into the mixture in each tube. 
Place at 37°C for 60 minutes, shaking vigorously (250 rpm) or rotating.
Warm selection plates to 37°C.
Mix the cells thoroughly by flicking the tube and inverting.
Perform several 10-fold serial dilutions in SOC.
Spread 50-100 µl of each dilution onto a selection plate. 
Incubate overnight at 37°C
