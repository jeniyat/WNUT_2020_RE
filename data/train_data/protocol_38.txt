CB-X™ Protein Assay for simple aqueous samples
Chill CB-X™ at -20°C.
Prior to use, mix CB-X™ Assay Dye by gently inverting the bottle several times.
DO NOT SHAKE THE BOTTLE.
Dilute the supplied protein standards in the same buffer as your protein samples.
We recommend duplicates of 5-6 dilutions within the range of 0.1-1.0mg/ml.
Transfer 50µl diluted protein standards and test samples to the assay tubes.
Set up a blank containing 50µl of the buffer used to generate the standards.
Add 1ml CB-X™ Assay Dye into each tube and mix well.
Incubate for 5 minutes at room temperature.
Read the absorbance at 595nm.
Prepare a standard calibration plot for the determination of protein concentration of the unknown samples.
