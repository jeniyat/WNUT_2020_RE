Isolation of DNA from phage lysate
Put phage lysate in plastic centrifuge bottle and add RNase (for 100 ml add 10 µl, for 150 ml add 15 µl, etc.)
Incubate 30 min. at room temperature. 
Add NaCl to a final concentration of 1M (for 100 ml add 6.5 g NaCl). 
Incubate for 1 hour on ice Centrifuge for 10 min. at 11,000xg (8,300 rpm on GSA rotor). 
Transfer supernatant to a new bottle. 
Add PEG 8000 at 100g/l (for 100 ml add 10 g PEG) and shake to mix. 
Incubate 1 hour on ice Centrifuge for 10 min. at 10,000xg (7,835 rpm on GSA rotor). 
Carefully pour out the supernatant to discard. 
Set the bottle upside down on paper towels/Kimwipes to drain remaining liquid. 
Rinse the inside of the bottle twice with SM buffer (total volume of 1-2 ml). 
Collect in 2 ml microcentrifuge tubes (1 ml per bottle). 
Shake resin to resuspend and heat TE to 80°C. 
Add 1 ml resin to each 2 ml tube.  
Mix by inversion. 
Attach column to 3 ml syringe and push sample through 1 ml at a time.  
Push 2 ml of 80% isopropanol through each column 1 ml at a time. 
Place column in original 2 ml tube. 
Centrifuge 2 min at 10,000xg to remove excess isopropanol. 
Place column in new 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube. 
Add 100 µl warm TE to elute. 
Briefly vortex Centrifuge for 30 sec. at 10,000xg.  
Check concentration of isolated DNA using NanoDrop.
Use Quant IT DNA quantification to validate NanoDrop readings
