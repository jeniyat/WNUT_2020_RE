Concentrating Viruses with an Amicon or Nanosep Centrifugal Ultrafiltration Device
Add your sample to the upper reservoir of the Amicon.
Centrifuge at 1000 x g at 4ºC in a swinging-bucket rotor.
Centrifuge time will depend on the volume of sample and the amount of material in the sample.
Continue centrifuging until the sample is reduced to the desired volume.
Remove the concentrated sample from the upper reservoir and place it in a tube of your choice.
Remove the upper reservoir from the Amicon device.
Place a square of parafilm over the bottom of the upper reservoir (Figure 1).
Add enough liquid to cover the filter (~1.5 ml).
Vortex the upper reservoir (filter/parafilm side down) at a setting of 1200 for ~20s.
Remove the liquid from the upper reservoir and add it to your recovered sample.
Repeat steps 8-10 to fully recover your sample.
Add your sample to the upper reservoir of the Nanosep.
Centrifuge at 1000 x g at 4ºC.
Centrifuge time will depend on the volume of sample and the amount of material in the sample.
Continue centrifuging until the sample is reduced to the desired volume.
Use a pipettor to remove the concentrated sample from the upper reservoir and place it in a tube of your choice.
Add enough liquid to cover the filter (~10 µl).
Swirl the liquid over the filter and stir it gently with a pipet tip.
Remove the liquid from the upper reservoir and add it to your recovered sample.
Repeat steps 17 to 19 to fully recover your sample.
