Extracting DNA from bananas
Mush the banana in the resealable bag for about a minute until it has a pudding-like consistency and all lumps are gone.
Fill a cup with the hot water and salt.
Pour the saltwater mix into the bag, and close the bag.
Gently mix and slosh the saltwater and mashed banana together for 30 to 45 seconds.
Add dishwashing soap into the bag and gently mix the contents.
You do not want the mixture to become too foamy.
Place the coffee filter in a clear glass cup, securing the top of the filter around the lip of the cup.
Pour the contents of the bag into the filter and let it sit until all of the liquid has dripped down into the cup.
Remove and discard the used coffee filter.
Tilt the glass and slowly add cold alcohol down the side of the cup until there is a layer that is 2.5-5cm (1-2in) thick.
Keep the alcohol and liquefied banana as separate as possible.
Let this two-layered mixture sit for eight minutes.
The longer you wait, the more defined this layer becomes.
This is the DNA pieces clumping together.
Stick the wooden stirrer into the cup.
Spin it in place so that cloudy layer spools around it.
Remove the stirrer.
The substance that you see on the stirrer is DNA!.
