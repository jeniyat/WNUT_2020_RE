BetaMark™ x-40 ELISA Kit (Chemiluminescent) Protocol
Label a 1L bottle as “1X Wash Buffer”.
Dilute 5X Wash Buffer 1:5 using lab grade water* and mix well.
*Note: Lab grade filtered water such as injection grade, cell culture grade, Reverse Osmosis De-Ionization(RODI).
Label an appropriate sized bottle as “1X Reagent Diluent”.
Label (2) 1.5mL microcentrifuge tubes as intermediate #1 & 2 (use enclosed tubes).
Add 990uL of standard diluent to intermediate tubes #1 & 2.
Reconstitute 20ug vial of 1-40 standard with 80uL of Standard Diluent.
Mix well by inversion, donot vortex.
Concentration will be 250ug/mL.
*Once reconstituted, standard must be used within the same day.
Add 10uL from the vial of reconstituted 1-40 standard to 990uL of standard diluent in intermediatetube #1.
Mix well by inversion, do not vortex.
Remove 10uL from intermediate #1 tube and add to 990uL standard diluent in intermediate #2 tube.
Mix well by inversion, do not vortex.
The final concentration of intermediate tube #2 will be 25ng/mL.
Label a 50mL centrifuge tube as “1X Incubation Buffer”.
Dilute 2X incubation buffer to 1X by adding 10mL of 2X incubation buffer to 10mL of lab grade water* in the 50mL tube labeled “1X Incubation Buffer”.
Mix well by vortexing.
This will be diluent for the standard curve and samples.
