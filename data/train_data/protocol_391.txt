Tube-O-Dialyzer (No Loss Dialyzer for Small Samples)
Tube‐O‐DIALYZER™ are supplied in a preservative to maintain quality.
Prior to use discard the preservative from the tube and place the dialysis cap upside down in a beaker or other suitable container.
Pipette your sample directly into the Tube‐O‐DIALYZER™ tube.
For Tube‐O‐DIALYZER™ Micro use 20‐250µl and for Tube‐O‐DIALYZER™ Medi use 0.2‐2.5ml.
Remove the Tube‐O‐DIALYZER™ dialysis cap from the rinse water/buffer and carefully remove excess liquid with a pipette tip.
Screw the dialysis cap on to the Tube‐O‐DIALYZER™ tube until finger tight.
Invert the Tube‐O‐DIALYZER™, ensuring the entire sample rests upon the membrane.
Keeping the Tube‐O‐DIALYZER™ in an inverted position, slide the supplied float onto the Tube‐O‐DIALYZER™ tube.
Place the Tube‐O‐DIALYZER™ in the dialysis buffer.
Ensure that the dialysis membrane contacts the dialysis buffer.
If there are large air bubbles trapped underneath the dialysis membrane surface, tilt the tube or squirt buffer to remove the air bubbles.
Dialysis Time:  Dialysis time will depend on the nature of sample, MWCO of the Tube‐O‐DIALYZER™, sample and dialysis buffer volume and concentration.
Higher MWCO will allow faster dialysis.
As a guide, the sample should be dialyzed for 2‐12h.
Dialysis buffer should also be replaced at least once during dialysis.
After dialysis, remove the Tube‐O‐DIALYZER™ from the float and immediately spin the Tube‐O‐DIALYZER™ (in up‐right position) for 5‐6 seconds at 500‐1,000xg.
Discard the dialysis cap and replace with the supplied Storage Cap.
Add 1‐2ml DI water or dialysis buffer to rinse.
Keep the Tube‐O‐DIALYZER™ membrane wet until required.
Gently, stir the dialysis buffer.
For efficient and complete dialysis we recommend inverting or gently tapping the Tube‐O‐DIALYZER™ 1‐2 times during dialysis to mix the sample.
