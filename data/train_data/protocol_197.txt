Metatranscriptomics sample preparation protocol w/ScriptSeq
Thaw 2-ml screw-cap tube on ice (should take a while).
If using sterivex filters, follow notes in annotations.
Lyse the cells on the filters: Remove the 300 µl RNAlater carefully and discard.
Add 750 µl (1.5mL)* Lysis/Binding buffer, vortex vigorously to completely lyse the cells.

Vortex to mix.
Leave the mixture on ice for 10 min.
Transfer the 825 µl lysate to a new Non-stick RNase-free tube or a 2 mL tube with o-ring (might need to spin the tubes to get as much lysate out as possible).

Centrifuge for 5 min at maximum 10,000 X g at RT.
Carefully remove the top aqueous phase w/o disturbing the lower phase, transfer it to a fresh tube.

Apply 700 µl miRNA Wash Solution 1 to the Filter Cartridge and centrifuge for 10 sec at 10,000 X g, discard the flow-through.
Apply 500 µl Wash Solution 2/3, spin 15 sec at 10,000 X g, and discard the flow-through.
Repeat step 14.
Put the Filter Cartridge back in the tube, centrifuge for 1.5 min at 10,000 X g to remove residual fluid from the filter.
Transfer the Filter Cartridge into a fresh collection tube, apply 50 µl pre-heated (95 ºC) Elution Solution (0.1 mM EDTA) to the center of the filter.

Transfer the spin column to a new 1.5 ml tube, pipet water or buffer directly onto the center of the silica-gel membrane, wait for 2 min at RT, close gently.
Centrifuge for 1 min at 12,000 X g to elute.
Repeat elution using 15 µl of water or buffer.
Store elutions at -80°C or continue with quantification.
Depending on your application, the recommended option for RNA quantification is:Bioanalyzer (Agilent) using the RNA 6000 Pico total RNA kit: quantitative range = 0.05-5.0 ng / µl (dilute samples 1:10 and 1:100 prior to analysis), allows visualization of RNA size distribution, less accurate, ~1 hr processing time.
Order primers (found in guidelines).
PCR amplify rRNA.
Template DNA100 ngBact 23S (35 cycles).
All other primers (35 cycles).  
Purify PCR products using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen)** with elution in 50 ul elution buffer and quantify DNA concentration using the Nanodrop (Nanodrop is fine here, as the PCR products should be at high conc. (>100 ng/µl)). 
Prepare separate reactions for all probes.
For a standard 20 µl reaction*: PCR amplicons, (step B1, suggest 250-500 ng)*1µl; ATP, (75 mM)2 µl; GTP, (75 mM)2 µl; CTP, (75 mM)1.5 µl; UTP, (75 mM)1.5 µl; Biotin-11-CTP, (10 mM, Roche 04739205001)3.75 µl; Biotin-16-UTP, (10 mM, Roche 11388908910)3.75 µl; 10X buffer, 2 µl; SUPERase•InTM RNase inhibitor, 0.5 µl; T7 RNA polymerase, 2 µl;

Bead washing (do this before or during the hybridization step).
For each sample, transfer 400 µl of beads* to a 1.5 ml tube.
Wash 1: bind beads to magnetic separation rack (takes ~2 min), pipet off and discard supernatant, re-suspend beads in equal volume of 0.1N NaOH (deactivates bead-associated RNases), and quick vortex to re-suspend, spin down, re-bind to magnet and pipet off supernatant.
Do this step quickly.
