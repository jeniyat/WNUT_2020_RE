Dephosphorylation using rSAP in Restriction Enzyme Reaction(M0371)
Digest 1–5 μg of plasmid DNA in a 20 μl reaction as follows: Incubate at 37°C for 60 minutes or follow manufacturer’s recommendations.
Add 1 unit of rSAP for every 1 pmol of DNA ends (about 1 μg of a 3 kb plasmid).
Incubate at 37°C for 30–60 minutes.
Stop reaction by heat-inactivation of rSAP and restriction enzyme (follow manufacturer's recommendations).
