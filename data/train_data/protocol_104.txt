Immunofluorescent Staining of Whole Blood
Add predetermined optimum concentrations of desired fluorochrome conjugated, biotinylated, orpurified primary antibodies to 100 Î¼l of anti-coagulated whole blood.
Incubate at room temperature for 15-20 minutes in the dark.
Dilute 10X Red Blood Cell (RBC) Lysis Buffer (BioLegend Cat. No. 420301) to 1X working concentration with DI water.
Warm to room temperature prior to use.
Add 2 ml of 1X RBC lysis solution to wholeblood/antibody mixture.
Incubate at room temperature for 10 minutes.
Centrifuge at 350 X g for 5 minutes, discard the supernatant.
Wash 1X with at least 2 ml of Cell Staining Buffer by centrifugation at 350 x g for 5 minutes.
If using a purified primary antibody, resuspend pellet in residual buffer and add a previously determined optimum concentration of anti-species immunoglobulin fluorochrome conjugated secondary antibody(e.g. FITC anti-mouse Ig) and incubate in the dark for 15-20 minutes.
Wash 1X with at least 2 ml of Cell Staining Buffer by centrifugation at 350 x g for 5 minutes.
Resuspend cells in 0.5 ml Cell Staining Buffer or 0.5 ml 2% paraformaldehyde-PBS fixation buffer.
Analyze with a Flow Cytometer.
