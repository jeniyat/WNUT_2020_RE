SpinOUT™: Protein Desalting
Equilibrate the column with the buffer of choice by applying at least 5 column volumes of buffer in batches of 1-2 column volumes.
Centrifuge the column at 1,000g for 2 minutes to remove the buffer after each application.
Place the column in a new collection tube and remove the cap.
Slowly, apply the protein solution to the center of the SpinOUT™ resin.
Centrifuge the column at 1,000g for the indicated times in the table below to collect the desalted protein solution.
Discard the column.
Mark one side of the column and ensure in all centrifugations the mark is facing outwards during centrifugation.
Prepare the SpinOUT™ column by centrifuging the SpinOUT™ columns at 1,000g for 1 minute to compact the resin.
Remove the top and then bottom caps.
Place into an appropriate collection tube.
Centrifuge the column at 1,000g for 2 minutes to remove the storage buffer.
