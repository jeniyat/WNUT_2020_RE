Colony PCR Protocol
Ligated DNA is transformed into cells.
Plate transformed cells on selection plate.
Go home, wait 13 hours.
Pick a well separated single colony from selection plate via yellow pipette tips.
Move said colony to 96 well microtittle plate.
Place individual colony into a single well containing 50 µl sterile distilled water.
Repeat for as many colonies as desired.
Make up PCR mix.
Use multichannel pipette to add 7.5 µl PCR mix to a 96 well PCR plate.
Add 2.5 µl colony solution.
Run PCR reaction.
Add 4 µl loading dye once PCR run is complete.
Load (PCR reaction mix + dye) into gel and run.
Complete run takes about 5 hours.
