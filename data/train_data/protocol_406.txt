OmniPrep™ For High Quality Genomic DNA Extraction From Paraffin-Embedded Tissue
Add 100µl xylene or safe xylene substitute and incubate at room temperature for 5 minutes with constant mixing.
(wash 1/3) Centrifuge at 14,000xg for 2 minutes and discard xylene or xylene substitute.
(wash 1/3) Add 100µl xylene or safe xylene substitute and incubate at room temperature for 5 minutes with constant mixing.
(wash 2/3) Centrifuge at 14,000xg for 2 minutes and discard xylene or xylene substitute.
(wash 3/3) Add 100µl 100% ethanol and incubate for 5 minutes at room temperature with constant mixing.
(wash 1/2) Allow the sample to cool to room temperature.
Add 200µl chloroform and mix by inverting the tube several times.
Centrifuge for 10 minutes at 14,000xg and carefully remove the upper phase to a clean microcentrifuge tube.
Add 50µl DNA Stripping Solution to the sample and invert several times to mix.
Incubate the sample for 5-10 minutes at 60°C.
Add 100µl Precipitation Solution and mix by inverting the tube several times.
Centrifuge the sample at 14,000xg for 5 minutes.
Transfer the supernatant to a clean tube and precipitate the genomic DNA with 500µl isopropanol.
Invert the tubes 10 times to precipitate the DNA.
OPTIONAL: For increased DNA recovery, add 2µl Mussel Glycogen as a DNA carrier.
Centrifuge at 14,000xg for 5 minutes to pellet genomic DNA.
Remove the supernatant.
Add 700µl 70% ethanol to the tube and invert several times to wash the DNA pellet.
Centrifuge for 1 minute at 14,000xg.
Decant or pipette off the ethanol wash.  
Invert the tube on a clean absorbent surface for several minutes to allow any excess ethanol to drain away.
Add 50µl TE Buffer to the pellet.
Incubate at room temperature for at least 15 minutes to rehydrate.
OPTIONAL: 1µl LongLife™ RNase for every 100µl TE Buffer can be added at this stage.
Store DNA at 4°C, for long term storage store at -20°C or -80°C.
Centrifuge at 14,000xg for 2 minutes and discard xylene or xylene substitute.
(wash 2/3) Add 100µl xylene or safe xylene substitute and incubate at room temperature for 5 minutes with constant mixing.
(wash 3/3) Centrifuge at 14,000xg for 2 minutes and discard ethanol.
(wash 1/2) Add 100µl 100% ethanol and incubate for 5 minutes at room temperature with constant mixing.
(wash 2/2) Centrifuge at 14,000xg for 2 minutes and discard ethanol.
(wash 2/2) Add 100µl Genomic Lysis Buffer and homogenize the sample with a microfuge pestle until a homogenous suspension is acquired, approximately 30-60 strokes.
Incubate the sample at 55-60°C for 15-60 minutes.
Do not heat higher than 60°C. 
OPTIONAL: For maximum DNA recovery, add 1µl Proteinase K solution for every 100µl Lysis Buffer and incubate at 60°C for 1-2 hours.
Invert the tube periodically each hour.
This step will digest hard to handle tissues and significantly improve the yield.
Finely chop 0.5-2mg paraffin-embedded tissue and place in 1.5ml microfuge tube.
