Electroporation Protocol
Turn on electroporator and set to 1.7-2.5 kv (optimize for strain), 200 ohms and 25 µF. 
Place recovery SOC in 37°C water bath. 
Pre-warm LB-antibiotic plates at 37°C. 
Thaw cells on ice for 10 min or use freshly made cells. 
Place appropriate number of microcentrifuge tubes and 1 mm-electroporation cuvettes on ice. 
Flick the tube containing cells a few times to mix and add 25 µl to the microcentrifuge tubes. 
Add 1 µl of a 10 pg/µl DNA solution (in DI water) to the cells in the microcentrifuge tube. 
Transfer the DNA-cell mixture to the cold cuvette, tap on countertop 2X, wipe water from exterior of cuvette and place in the electroporation module and press pulse (don’t hold the button down). 
Immediately add 975 µl of 37°C SOC, mix by pipetting up and down once and transfer to a 15 ml-falcon tube. 
Rotate in the 37°C incubator for 1 h. 
Make appropriate dilutions. 
Incubate overnight at 37°C.
