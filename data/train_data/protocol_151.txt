SpinOUT™: Buffer Exchange
Mark one side of the column and ensure in all centrifugations the mark is facing outwards during centrifugation.
Prepare the SpinOUT™ column by centrifuging the SpinOUT™ columns at 1,000g for 1 minute to compact the resin.
Remove the top and then bottom caps.
Place into an appropriate collection tube.
Centrifuge the column at 1,000g for 2 minutes to remove the storage buffer.
Place the column in a new collection tube and remove the cap.
Add the buffer to be exchanged into to the columna.
For 0.1ml column, use 75µl bufferb.
For 1ml column, use 0.5ml bufferc.
For 3ml column, use 1.5ml bufferd.
For 5ml column, use 2.5ml buffere.
For 10ml column, use 5ml buffer Centrifuge the column at 1,000g for 2 minutes to remove the buffer.
Repeat steps 6 and 7, a further five more times, ensuring the buffer is discarded after each centrifugation.
Place the column in a new collection tube and remove the cap.
Slowly, apply the protein solution to the center of the SpinOUT™ resin.
The recommended volumes to apply to the column are as follows
Discard the column.
