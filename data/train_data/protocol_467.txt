Remove bottles from soap, and rinse thoroughly 7 times inside, and a few times outside to remove soap.
Place bottles upside down into a 1N HCl bath.
Leave for one week, perhaps inverting at some point to make sure all surfaces are exposed.
Remove bottles and caps from the bath and rinse thoroughly 7 times to remove most of the HCl.
Dry, sticker, double bag for placement into boxes for shipping.
Each crate should be ziptied and stickered, and contain two zipties taped to lid, one card, a large interior bag, and twelve bottles, each of which are double-bagged.
