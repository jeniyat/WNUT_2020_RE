Making your own electrocompetent cells
Innoculate 1 colony from a fresh plate of the strain to be made electrocompetent into 10 ml of SOB in a 125 ml flask. 
Incubate for 16-18 hours at 37°C and 250 rpm. 
Pre-warm 2, 1 L flasks containing 250 ml each of SOB. 
Add two drops of the overnight culture to each of the pre-warmed 250 ml flasks. 
Shake at 37°C and 250 rpm until the cultures reach an OD600 of 0.5-0.7. 
Turn on centrifuge and cool rotor to 4°C well in advance of harvesting cells. 
Place 1 L of 10% glycerol on ice well in advance of harvesting cells. 
Place cultures on ice for 15 minutes.
From this point on the cultures must be kept ice cold. 
Pour each 250 ml culture into chilled 500 ml (or 1000 ml) centrifuge bottles. 
Centrifuge at 5000 rpm for 10 min.  
Pour off the supernatant and aspirate any residual broth. 
Add 250 ml of glycerol to each of the centrifuge bottles and completely suspend the cells by pipetting up and down. 
Centrifuge at 5000 rpm for 10 min.  
Pour off the supernatant, it is not necessary to aspirate. 
Add 250 ml of glycerol to each of the centrifuge bottles and completely suspend the cells by pipetting up and down. 
Pour off the supernatant and suspend the cells in the residual glycerol by pipetting up and down. 
To freeze, add 100 µl of the culture to microcentrifuge tubes on ice. 
Once you have used all of the culture, transfer the tubes to dry ice for 10 minutes. 
Once the cultures are frozen, transfer them to a -80°C freezer
