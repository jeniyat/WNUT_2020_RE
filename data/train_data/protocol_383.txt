Frying Chips for Frying Oil Studies (Food Science)
Fill Fry Daddy with 900 g liquid soybean (or other edible) oil.
Plug in Fry Daddy and heat to frying temperature (180 C).
Use a temperature controller if necessary.
Log temperature data using a computer if desired.
Weigh chips initially (approximately 40 g, or 20-25 chips).
Fry chips in the basket provided for 2 minutes.
Lift the basket, drain the chips well, and dump onto a paper towel to drain and cool.
Spread chips out so that they all have contact with the paper towel.
Wait for them to dry a bit.
Turn chips on the paper towels if necessary to get rid of any pooled oil.
Put chips back into weigh boats and record a final weight.
Store chips covered in an airtight container.
