Electron Microscopy of Haloviruses
A sample of virus is placed on a sterile surface and the grid, plastic-coated side down, placed on the droplet for 1.5–2 min.
The grid is then placed, for 1–1.5 min, on a drop of freshly filtered 2% w/v uranyl acetate and excess stain removed with filter paper.
After air drying, grids may be examined by transmission electron microscopy, as described in guidelines (Fig. 3A, B, and C in guidelines).
