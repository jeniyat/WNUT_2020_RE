Sampling for extracellular phage quantification by qPCR and MPN assays
Place filter plate (MSGVN2210) onto receiver 96-well plate without touching the bottom of the sterile filter plate.
Keep a log of your sample layout (which samples are in which wells).
Plate-Setup Template:  Transfer 250 µL of sample from each experimental bottle/tube into empty wells on the filter plate in duplicate.
It is not necessary to fill the entire plate; we will continue to use the same plate over the course of the experiment.
Centrifuge at 1000 x g for 3 min.
Be sure to balance the centrifuge.
Between sampling, store stacked filter/filtrate plates at 4°C, covered with a plate lid.
Do not disturb the stacked plates, to avoid cross-contamination between wells.
After filling the entire plate, remove the filter plate and discard.
Store the filtrate plate at 4°C, covered with a plate lid and wrapped well with parafilm, until analysis.
