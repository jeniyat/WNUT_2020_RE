Preparation of Denaturing Agarose Gel for RNA Analysis
Melt 1.0 g agarose in 87 ml of DEPC water, by dispersing the agarose uniformly and heating in a microwave until all particles are dissolved.
Bring the melted agarose to 60 °C.
Add 10 ml 10X MOPS Buffer and 3 ml 37% formaldehyde.
Pour standard agarose gel gel.
USE A FUME HOOD!
FORMALDEHYDE IS VOLATILE AND TOXIC.
WORK IN A HOOD FROM THIS POINT FORWARD.
Allow gel to set for 1 hour.
Run gel in 1X MOPS Buffer.
Mix 40 µl sample buffer with 10 µl sample, heat to 55 °C 15 minutes.
Add 10µl of the following:  50% glycerol 1 mM EDTA 0.3% each bromophenol blue and 0.3% xylene cyanol.
