SWIFT™ Western Transfer Pads
Soak the PVDF membrane in 100% methanol for 1‐2 minutes then rinse 2‐3 times with deionized water.   
Equilibrate PVDF or nitrocellulose membrane in diluted SWIFT™ Western Buffer for 5‐10 minutes. 
Place the supplied SWIFT™ Template Card on a flat surface and place a SWIFT™ Western Transfer Pad on the Template Card.
Add diluted SWIFT™ Western Buffer on top of the pad to soak it further.
Use 2ml each for the 8.5 x 7.5cm and 5ml each for the 15 x 9.5cm size pads.
Carefully place the gel on top of the SWIFT™ Western Transfer Pad and ensure no air bubbles are formed.
Incubate for 5 minutes at room temperature.
The incubation step improves protein transfer efficiency.
Place the blotting membrane equilibrated in diluted SWIFT™ Western Buffer on top of the gel, avoiding air bubbles.
Place another piece of SWIFT™ Western Transfer Pad on top of the membrane, avoiding air bubbles.
Remove any air bubbles by rolling a tube or pipette over the top of the sandwich.
Slide the blot sandwich onto a transfer cassette, including fiber pads soaked in diluted SWIFT™ Western Buffer.
Put the assembled transfer cassette in a Western transfer module with diluted SWIFT™ Western Buffer and run it for 30‐60 minutes at 200mA fixed current.
