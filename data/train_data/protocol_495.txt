Quick Protocol for Monarch® PCR & DNA Cleanup Kit (5 μg) (NEB #T1030)
Dilute sample with DNA Cleanup Binding Buffer according to the table below.
Mix well by pipetting up and down or flicking the tube.
Do not vortex.
A sample volume of 20–100 μl is recommended.
For smaller samples, TE can be used to adjust the volume.
For diluted samples larger than 800 μl, load a portion of the sample, proceed with step 2, and then repeat as necessary.

Insert column into collection tube and load sample onto column.
Spin for 1 minute at 16,000 x g, then discard flow-through.
Re-insert column into collection tube.
Add 200 μl DNA Wash Buffer (with ethanol added) and spin for 1 minute at 16,000 x g. 
Discarding flow-through is optional.
Repeat Step 3.
(Step 3: Re-insert column into collection tube.
Add 200 μl DNA Wash Buffer and spin for 1 minute at 16,000 x g. 
Discarding flow-through is optional).
Transfer column to a clean 1.5 ml microfuge tube.
Use care to ensure that the tip of the column does not come into contact with the flow-through.
If in doubt, re-spin for 1 minute.
Add ≥ 6 μl of DNA Elution Buffer to the center of the matrix.
Wait for 1 minute, then spin for 1 minute at 16,000 x g to elute the DNA.
