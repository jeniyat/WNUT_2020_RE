PCR with Q5® High-Fidelity 2X Master Mix (M0492)
Set up the following reaction on ice: Q5 High-Fidelity 2X Master Mix, 12.5 µl, 25 µl, 1X; 10 µM, Forward Primer, 1.25 µl, 2.5 µl, 0.5 µM; 10 µM, Reverse Primer, 1.25 µl, 2.5 µl, 0.5 µM; Template DNA variable variable< 1,000 ng Nuclease-Free Water, to 25 µl, to 50 µl.  
Gently mix the reaction.
Collect all liquid to the bottom of the tube by a quick spin if necessary and overlay the sample with mineral oil if using a PCR machine without a heated lid.
Quickly transfer PCR tubes to a thermocycler preheated to the denaturation temperature (98°C).
