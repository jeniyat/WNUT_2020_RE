Buccopharyngeal morphology of tadpoles in Scanning Electron Microscope
Wash quickly the specimens in tap water and dissect tadpoles following Wassersug (1976: p. 4-5).
Prepare the fixing solution. 
Fix the dissections in 4% Glutaraldehyde diluted in the fixing solution. 
Post fix the dissections in 1% Osmium tetroxide solution.
Dehydrate in an ascending series of acetones, starting at 30%. 
Transfer to acetone 50%. 
Transfer to acetone 70%. 
Transfer to acetone 90%. 
Transfer to acetone 95%. 
Transfer to another solution of acetone 95%. 
Transfer to another solution of acetone 95%. 
Transfer to acetone 100%. 
Transfer to another solution of acetone 100%. 
Now take your specimens to a Critical Point Dryer. 
Mount the specimens on stubs and attach them with a double-sided tape. 
Take the specimens to the High Vaccum Coater and you're ready to analyze them.
