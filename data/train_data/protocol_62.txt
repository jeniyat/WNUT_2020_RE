Chlorophyll Extraction in Cyanobacteria
Take 1 ml sample of your cyanobacteria culture and spin it down at 14,000 rpm for 5 min.
Discard 0.9 ml of the supernatant.
Resuspend the pellet in the remaining 100 µl.
Add 0.9 ml of 100% methanol to the sample and mix thoroughly by vortexing.
Incubate the samples in the dark for 30 min at 4 °C in the fridge.
Spin down samples again at 14,000 rpm for 5 min.
Transfer supernatant into a cuvette and measure the extinction at 665 nm.
Use 90% methanol as the reference solution.
