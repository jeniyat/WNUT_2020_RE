Yeast DAPI Staining
Grow up yeast in liquid medium overnight.
Add 333 μL (or 1 volume) yeast culture to a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.
Add 666 μL (or 2 volume) of 100% Ethanol to the 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.
Let the yeast ethanol mixture sit at room temperature for 30-60 minutes.
Spin down yeast cells for 1 minute at 2500 RPM.
Pour out the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 1mL of 1 x PBS, then centrifuge for 1 minute at 2500 RPM.
Pour out the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 200 μL of a 1 x PBS / 1:2000 Dilution DAPI mixture.
Add one drop of the yeast suspended in the PBS / DAPI mixture onto a microscope slide, add a coverslip on top, and go observe the stained yeast.
