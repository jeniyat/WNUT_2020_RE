One-step growth experiments (cyanophages)
Set up triplicate adsorption tubes (AT) in 1.5 mL microtubes.
Add phages of a known titer to the cyanobacteria host in exponential growth (cell concentration determined by microscopy; Cyanoinput) at an MOI of approximately 0.02.
Allow the phages to adsorb to the hosts for 60 mins at room temperature and an illumination of 25µmol quanta m–2s–1.
Set up control tubes (CT) as above, except: 
a. positive controls: replace host cells with media (this gives input phage numbers).
b. negative controls: omit virus After 60 min, remove unadsorbed phages (T = 0). 
Prepare nine 15-mL centrifuge tubes containing 10 mL algal growth media. 
Add 100 µL from AT to FGT (10–2 dilution).
Mix and remove 0.1 mL sample for T = 0.
Perform plaque assay immediately to determine total infective centers (TICT=0).
Add 100 µL from FGT to SGT (10–4 dilution).
Incubate FGT and SGT tubes at room temperature and ca.
25 µmol quanta m–2s–1 Remove 100 µL samples every 3 h from FGT (at 3, 6, 9, 12, 16 h) and SGT (from 12 h onwards) for ca. 30 h. 
Determine the TIC via plaque assay.
Add 100 µL from positive control tube (CT) to FGT-control (10–2 dilution).
Determine the total phage input (Phageinput).
