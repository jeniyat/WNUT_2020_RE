Quanti-iT™ Pico Green dsDNA Assay (Invitrogen P7589)
Warm Quant-iT PicoGreen reagent to room temp in the dark.
Prepare 1XTE buffer from 20X stock solution using nuclease-free water:  will need 200 μl/well (for diluting standards, samples and PicoGreen).
Dilute DNA standard to either “High” 2 μg/mL (1:50 of λ DNA stock) or “Low” 50 ng/mL (1:1000 of λ DNA stock).
Determine amount of sample to assay (eg, 2μl sample in total of 100μl TE buffer).
Add correct amount of TE buffer to all wells.
Add standards to wells.
Then add samples to wells.
Dilute PicoGreen 1:200 in TE buffer and protect from light until ready to add to plate.
Add equivalent volume (100 μl) of diluted PicoGreen to every well (keeping plate in the dark as much as possible).
Tap plate to mix.
Incubate 5 minutes at room temperature keeping plate in the dark.
Take fluorescent readings using 485nm excitation and 535nm emission filters.
Determine standard curve and calculate concentration of DNA in samples (see table in the guidelines).
