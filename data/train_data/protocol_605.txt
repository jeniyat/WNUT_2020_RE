Monterey Wharf II Weekly Phytoplankton Monitoring Sample Collection and Processing. 
Notes A vertical net tow is collected using a 25µm mesh plankton net with a 200mL cod-end piece at a depth of 5 m. 
Total phytoplankton biomass is estimated from in vivo chlorphyll fluorescence on dark adapted net and whole water samples using a calibrated Aquaflor fluorometer (Turner Designs).
Vertical whole water samples are collected using a VanDorn at discreet 1m intervals and integrated over 5m.
Species relative abundance is assessed microscopically from 1% glutaraldehyde preserved samples quantified on a nanoplankton counting chamber (Phycotech).
The following samples are processed and archived for later analysis:
Nutrients: Whole water is passed through a 0.2 µm syringe filter and stored at -20°C.
Nucleic Acids: 50 mLs of the net tow sample are filtered through 1.2µm Isopore membrane filter (Millipore) and extracted into Trizol (Invitrogen) before being archived at -80°C.
Protein and Amino Acids: 50mLs of the net tow are filtered through 2µm Isopore membrane filter (Millipore) and extracted into 80% Methanol before being archived at -80°C.
Pigment: 25mLs of the net tow are filtered through Glass Microfibre Filters (Whatman) and archived at -80°C.
