Incubate samples in a thermocycler at 50°C for 15 minutes (when 2 or 3 fragments are being assembled) or 60 minutes (when 4–6 fragments are being assembled).
Following incubation, store samples on ice or at –20°C for subsequent transformation.
Transform NEB 5-alpha Competent E. coli cells (provided in the cloning kit or purchased separately from NEB) with 2 μl of the assembled product, following the transformation protocol.
