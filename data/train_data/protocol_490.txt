Plasmid DNA miniprep protocol for EZ-10 Spin Column Plasmid DNA minipreps kit (BS413), 50 preps
Add 1.5 mL of overnight culture to a microcentrifuge tube and centrifuge at 12,000rpm for 2 minutes.
Drain the clarified supernatant completely leaving only the cell pellet.
Optional: Depending on ease of plasmid replication add a further 1.5 mL of overnight culture to the microcentrifuge tube containing the previous pellet and repeat until a maximum of 5 mL of overnight culture has been added.
Add 100uL of Solution 1 to the pellet, mix well, ensuring that no clumps are present and let sit for 1 min. 
Add 1μL of VisualLyse to the solution from step 2 (optional). 
Add 200µl of Solution II to the mixture, and mix gently by inverting the tube 4-6 times and then keep at room temperature for 1 minute.
To prevent contamination from genomic DNA, do not vortex.
Add 350µl of Solution III, and mix gently.
Incubate at room temperature for 1 minute.
A fluffy white material forms and lysate should become less viscous.
If VisualLyse has been added in step 3, the suspension should be mixed until all traces of blue has gone and lysate becomes colorless.
Centrifuge at 12,000rpm for 5 minutes. 
Transfer the above supernatant (step 6) to the EZ-10 column.
Centrifuge at 10,000rpm for 2 minutes.  
Discard the flow-through in the tube.
Add 750µl of Wash Solution to the column, and centrifuge at 10,000rpm for 2 minutes. 
Repeat wash procedure in step 8. 
Discard the flow-through in the collection tube.
Centrifuge at 10,000rpm for an additional minute to remove any residual Wash Solution. 
Transfer the column to a clean 1.5ml microfuge tube (BT620-NS).
Add 50µl of Elution Buffer into the center part of the column and incubate at room temperature for 2 minutes.
Store purified DNA at -20ºC Centrifuge at 10,000 rpm for 2 minutes
