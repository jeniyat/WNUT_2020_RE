Checking DNA Concentration with Agarose Gel
Prepare 0.7% agarose. 
Post-stain with SYBR Gold. 
While the gel is cooling, prepare samples: 1µl of 10x loading buffer per 10µl of sample. 
Prepare the appropriate dilutions of the appropriate marker (commonly 10ng of HINDIII [lambda] DNA). 
Add running buffer to cover gel. 
Gently rock the comb before pulling it out. 
Run at 50V about 2-4 hours to get clean band separations. 
Post-stain the gel in SYBR Gold ‘bath’ (20ul SYBR: 200ml TAE for 30 minutes).
Compare gel quantification to that obtained using Nanodrop to get a feeling for how ‘clean’ the DNA prep is.
