Whole protein extraction from tissues
Pre-cool lysis buffer on ice.
Add protease inhibitors just before using.
Add 10 fold lysis buffer to tissues (1ml lysis buffer / 100mg tissue).
Homogenize tissues with dispenser ( working time 10s / rest time 20s, repeat 5 times) until no visible tissue blocks.
Mix samples on a rotating mixer at 4 °C for 2h.
Spin @ 16,000g, 10min, 4°C.
If necessary, centrifuge again.
Save supernatant.
Determine protein conc.
Make aliquots and store in -80°C.
