SYBR Green or Gold Staining
Make dilution of virus prep in 0.02µm filtered seawater (100 kDa permeate if available).
Add diluted virus to 1 ml 0.02 µm filtered seawater and add 1 µl SYBR green or gold (10,000x stock) to solution.
Incubate RT, in the dark for 15 min.
Prepare 25mm SYBR towers: use 0.02µm Anodiscs, careful not to break membrane.
Filter sample onto membrane (use vacuum).
Rinse tower in 1L Q-water in between samples and blot onto paper towel to dry.
Remove membrane and place cell-side up on microscope slide.
Pipet 32µl 0.1% phenylenediamine (made in PBS/50% glycerol) on 22mm square coverslip.
Invert over filter on microscope slide and press down to spread mounting medium.
Place slide at –20°C to enhance fluorescence.
Read slides using 100x oil immersion objective and inverted fluorescent microscope.
