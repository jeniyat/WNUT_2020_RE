A Non-Interfering™ (NI) Protein Assay
Perform assays at room temperature.
Use 2ml tubes for assay.
Prepare a set of protein standards using the supplied BSA or Non-Animal Protein Standard as indicated in the table below: 
Tube #123456Protein Standard [2mg/ml] (µl)048122025Protein (µg)0816244050.
Add 1-50µl of the protein samples to be assayed to 2ml tubes.
Add 0.5ml UPPA™ I to each tube and vortex.
Incubate for 2-3 minutes at room temperature.
Add 0.5ml UPPA™ II to the tubes and vortex.
Centrifuge the tubes at maximum speed (~10,000xg) for 5 minutes to pellet the precipitated protein.
Decant off the supernatant, return the tubes to the centrifuge as before, quickly pulse to spin down residual liquid and remove with a pipette.
Add 100µl Copper Solution (Reagent I) and 400µl deionized water to the tubes and vortex until the protein precipitate pellet dissolves.
Using 1ml pipette, rapidly shoot 1ml Reagent II directly into each tube containing Reagent I plus DI Water and immediately mix it by inverting the tubes.
Incubate at room temperature for 15-20 minutes and then immediately read absorbances at 480nm against DI water.
Plot absorbance against protein concentration and determine protein concentrations of unknowns.
