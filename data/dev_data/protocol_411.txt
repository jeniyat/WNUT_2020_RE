Investigating non-specific protein binding and streptavidin binding using QCM-D sensing
Prepare a Hepes Buffered Saline (HBS) solution containing 150 mM NaCl and 10 mM Hepes.
Then prepare a solution of 25 µg/ml streptavidin in HBS.
Using QCM-D sensing, make a baseline of the HBS solution.
Expose the modified sensors to non-diluted Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) for 30-60 min under static conditions in QCM-D and measure the amount of adsorbed FBS relative to the HBS baseline obtained in the previous step.
Rinse the sensors with the HBS solution.
Flow the streptavidin solution over the modified sensors (100-500 µl/min), until they are saturated.
Rinse the sensors with the HBS solution.
