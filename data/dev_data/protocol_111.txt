One-step growth curves for Cellulophaga phages
Inoculate a new culture; ie, pick a colony into a new flask containing 10 ml of MLB media. 
Immediately after the transfer, take a ‘time 0’ growth reading (T0).
Continue taking readings as performed in step 2 periodically.
Do a plaque assay to determine the PFU/ml of the lysate you plan to use.
Calculate the volume needed for 107 phages.
Determine the concentration of your culture at the time you start the infection.
Calculate the volume of host culture needed for 108 cells.
Pipet this amount into a 1.5 ml tube.
Add 107 phages to the tube and start your timer for 15 minutes to allow the phages to adsorb to the host cells.
After 15 minutes, dilute the infection 1:1000 in MLB media in a 250 ml flask.
Take a sample immediately after dilution. 
Continue sampling in this way for 8 hours.  
Store the filtered samples at 4°C.
The next day, count the plaques on all plates that have a countable number of them. 
Decide which dilution gives the best count at each time point for the next time you do this same phage-host pair.
The next day, count any new plaques that have appeared and add these to your original count.
Count again on the third day.
Calculate PFU/ml at each time point for both the centrifuged (free phage only) and not centrifuged (total phage) samples.
