Nitrite reagent for dissolved cobalt analyses
Add 12.9 g of sodium nitrite per 125 mL of Milli-Q, by weighing the sodium nitrite directly into a large trace metal clean bottle.
Add 125 mL of Milli-Q to the bottle by weight.
Add clean Chelex-100 resin to the bottle and place it on a shaker overnight to ensure the Chelex mixes throughout the solution.
The following morning, slowly pour the solution through an HPLC column with a frit in order to filter the chelex and allow the solution to pass into a trace metal clean bottle.
Make sure to test the reagent before use to ensure it is clean.
