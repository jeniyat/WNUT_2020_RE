Generating CB-X™ Tables and standard curves for CB-X Protein Assay Optimization. 
Prepare duplicate standards of choice in your buffer of choice at the following concentrations: 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0µg/µl Transfer 50µl protein standard to 1.5ml centrifuge tubes.
Prepare a standard calibration plot for the determination of protein concentration of the unknown samples.
Use the line equation to generate your own CB-X™ Tables.
This CB-X™ Table will allow all your future protein estimations to be performed without using protein standards, allowing you to carry out rapid, single protein estimations.
Add 1ml pre-chilled (-20°C) CB-X™ and vortex to mix.
Centrifuge at 16,000xg for 5 minutes and carefully remove all the supernatant without disturbing the protein pellet.
Add 50µl CB-X™ Solubilization Buffer-I and 50µl CB-X™ Solubilization Buffer-II to the tube and vortex to dissolve the protein pellet.
Invert the CB-X™ Assay Dye 2-3 times to mix and add 1ml CB-X™ Assay Dye to the tube and vortex briefly.
Incubate for 5 minutes at room temperature.
Read the absorbance at 595nm against deionized water using either a 1cm path length cuvette or transfer 200µl assay solution to a microtiter well.
