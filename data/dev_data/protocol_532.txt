Ethanol Fixation Protocol
Prepare 70% Ethanol and chill to -20°C(NOTE: Do not freeze ethanol for long-term storage).
Prepare target cells of interest and wash 2X with PBS, centrifuging at 350xg for 5 minutes.
Discard supernatant and loosen the cell pellet by vortexing.
Add 3 ml cold 70% ethanol drop by drop to the cell pellet while vortexing.
Continue vortexing for 30 seconds.
Incubate at -20°C for 1 hour. 
Wash 2X with BioLegend Cell Staining Buffer (Cat.#420201) and resuspend cells at 0.5-1.0 x 107 cells/ml.
Use 100 μl cell suspension/staining tube.
