Capped RNA Synthesis (E2050)
Prepare 40 mM cap analog. 
Thaw the necessary kit components, mix and pulse-spin in a microfuge to collect solutions to the bottoms of tubes. 
Assemble the reaction at room temperature in the following order. 
Mix thoroughly and pulse-spin.  
Incubate at 37°C for 2 hours. 
Optional step: To remove template DNA, add 2 μl of DNase I (RNase-free), mix and incubate at 37°C for 15 minutes.
Proceed with purification of synthesized RNA or analysis of transcription products by gel electrophoresis
