Ligation of Sticky Ends with T4
Thaw the T4 DNA Ligase Buffer and resuspended at room temperature.
Set up the following reaction mixture at room temp:10x, T4 DNA Ligase Buffer; 2 ul, Vector DNA; 0.020, pmol.
Insert DNA, 0.060 pmol; Nuclease-free Water to 20 ul; T4 DNA Ligase, 1 ul. 
Gently mix the reaction by pipetting up and down and microfuge briefly.
For sticky ends, incubate at 22 C for 10 minutes.
Heat inactivate at 65 degrees C for 10 minutes.
Chill on ice and transform 1-5 μl of the reaction into 50 μl competent cells.
