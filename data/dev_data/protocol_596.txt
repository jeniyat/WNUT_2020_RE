Plant Protoplast Encapsulation. 
Gently load plant protoplast suspensions into hamilton gas-tight syringe.
Load 2.5% wt% Pico-Surf(TM) 1in Novec 7500 into hamilton gas-tight syringe.
Place the microfluidic device to the stage of bright-field inverted microscope which connects with a high-speed camera.
Connect the syringes to the corresponding inlets of the microfluidic chip via PTFE microtubing.
Load onto Harvard Apparatus, PHD 2000 syringe pump and start infusing.
Record the encapsulation videos with the fast camera (PHANTOM MIROEX4) using the manufacturer's software.
Image the plant protoplasts in droplets with Andor iXon Ultra 897 camera for fluorescence and bright field images, controlled with the Labview software.
