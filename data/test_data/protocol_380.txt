One-Step Transformation of Yeast
Add 90 uL of 50% Polyethylene Glycol 3350 to a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.
Add 10 uL of 0.2 N Lithium Acetate to the microcentrifuge tube.
Pellet yeast from 1 mL liquid culture or take a toothpick full of freshly grown yeast on a plate and resuspend in the solution.
Add 1 ug of DNA and briefly vortex.
Incubate at 45°C for 30 minutes to 1 hour, vortexing briefly every 10 minutes.
Add 1 mL water to the tube and pipette to mix, then centrifuge at 14,000 RPM for 15 seconds.
Remove the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 200 uL water, then spread on selective plates and incubate at 30°C for 3-6 days.
