DNase I Treatment
DNase I made up to 40,000 U/ml in storage buffer (-20°C freezer door) = stock solution.
Dilute stock solution 1:40 in 10x reaction buffer = 1,000 U/ml = 1 U/ul = working dilution.
Use at a 1:10 dilution: 1μl per 9 μl solution to be treated.
Incubate at room temperature for 2hr.
Prepare 1M EDTA disodium salt dihydrate.
Prepare 1M EGTA tetrasodium salt.
Inactivate DNase by adding 100 mM EDTA/100 mM EGTA final concentration.
