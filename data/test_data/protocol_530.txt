A Non-Interfering™ (NI) Protein Assay (high throughput 96-well)
Perform assays at room temperature.
Use 2ml tubes for assay.
Prepare a set of protein standards using the supplied BSA or Non-Animal Protein Standard as indicated in the table below: 
Tube #123456Protein Standard [2mg/ml] (µl)048122025Protein (µg)0816244050. 
Add 1-50µl of the protein samples to be assayed to 2ml tubes.
Add 0.5ml UPPA™ I to each tube and vortex.
Add 0.5ml UPPA™ II to the tubes and vortex.
Incubate for 2-3 minutes at room temperature.
Centrifuge the titer plate at ~5,000xg for 7 minutes to pellet the precipitate.
Invert the titer plate to remove the supernatant and shake to remove all excess supernatant.
Add 100µl Copper Solution (Reagent I) and 400µl deionized water to the tubes and vortex until the protein precipitate pellet dissolves.
Using 1ml pipette, rapidly shoot 1ml Reagent II directly into each tube containing Reagent I plus DI Water and immediately mix it by inverting the tubes.
Incubate at room temperature for 15-20 minutes and then immediately read absorbances at 480nm against DI water.
After incubation, transfer 200µl assay reaction to a flat bottom 96 well micro titer plate and measure the absorbances at 480nm against DI water.
Plot absorbance against protein concentration and determine protein concentrations of unknowns.
