Quick Protocol for Monarch® DNA Gel Extraction Kit (NEB #T1020) Excise the DNA fragment from the agarose gel, taking care to trim excess agarose.
Transfer to a 1.5 ml microfuge tube and weigh the gel slice.
Minimize exposure to UV light.
Add 4 volumes of Gel Dissolving Buffer to the gel slice (e.g., 400 μl buffer per 100 μl or 100 mg agarose).
Incubate the sample between 37–55°C (typically 50°C), until the gel slice is completely dissolved (generally 5–10 minutes).
The time that takes a gel slice to melt depends on the size of the slice, the temperature used in the incubation as well as the percent agarose used in the gel.
The time recommended above should be used just as a guideline.
Insert column into collection tube and load sample onto the column.
Spin for 1 minute at 16,000 x g, then discard flow-through.
Re-insert column into collection tube.
Add 200 μl DNA Wash Buffer (with ethanol added) and spin for 1 minute at 16,000 x g. 
Discarding flow-through is optional.
Repeat Step 5 (Step 5: Re-insert column into collection tube.
Add 200 μl DNA Wash Buffer and spin for 1 minute at 16,000 x g. 
Discarding flow-through is optional).
Transfer column to a clean 1.5 ml microfuge tube.
Use care to ensure that the tip of the column does not come into contact with the flow-through.
If in doubt, re-spin for 1 minute.
Add ≥ 6 μl of DNA Elution Buffer to the center of the matrix.
Wait for 1 minute, and spin for 1 minute at 16,000 x g to elute the DNA.
