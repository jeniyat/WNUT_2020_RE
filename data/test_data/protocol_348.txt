Release of nucleic acids with heat, chelator, and detergent
Concentrate the viruses by centrifuging in the centrifugal ultrafiltration device at 1000g until only a small volume (ca. 10 µL) remains.
Add 100 µL TE (or TEGED).
Concentrate the sample again to ca. 10 µL.
Repeat steps 2 and 3 once more.
Recover the final concentrate.
Rinse the membrane in the device by adding a small volume of TE or TEGED (5–10 µL).
Recover the rinse and pool with the concentrate.
Optional: If conducting electrophoresis on the sample, add SDS-EDTA loading dye to a final concentration of 1×.
Heat the recovered sample (with or without loading buffer) to 60°C for 10 min to release the nucleic acid.
