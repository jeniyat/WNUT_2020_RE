Set up the following reaction on ice.
Gently mix the reaction.
Collect all liquid to the bottom of the tube by a quick spin if necessary and overlay the sample with mineral oil if using a PCR machine without a heated lid.
Transfer PCR tubes from ice to a PCR machine with the block preheated to 95°C and begin thermocycling.
