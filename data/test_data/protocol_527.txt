Swift™ Membrane Stain
Following protein transfer to a membrane, place the membrane in a suitable tray.
a. For PVDF Membranes: 
Add 20ml 100% methanol and rinse for 10‐30 seconds.
Discard the methanol and immediately add 12ml Swift™ Membrane Stain.
b. For Nitrocellulose Membranes: 
Add 20ml deionized water and rinse for 30 seconds.
Discard the wash and add 12ml Swift™ Membrane Stain.
Place the trays on a rocking shaker.
Protein bands appear in ~30 seconds.
Rinse the membrane in DI water to remove the staining solution for improved image capture by scanning or photography.
For rapid de‐staining of the membranes, rinse the membrane in DI water to remove staining solution.
Wash the membranes for 30‐60 seconds in 50ml 1X Swift™ Destain, or until the stain has been removed.
Once de‐stained, rinse in DI water and store the blot in DI water until required.
