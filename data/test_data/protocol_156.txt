General tube bacteria extraction (DNeasy)
Place Buffer ATL and Buffer Al at 56C for at least 5 minutes before starting.
Make sure AW1 and AW2 have ethanol added.
Spin >500ul of bacteria liquid culture at 10000g for 10 minutes.
Pour off supernatant.
Add 200ul buffer ATL to each sample and vortex for 15s.
Add 200ul 100% ethanol to each sample and vortex for 15s.
Briefly spin to collect all liquid.
Transfer all of sample including precipitate to spin column.
Centrifuge at max speed (>20000g) for 2 minutes.
Empty collection tube.
Add 500ul buffer AW1 to spin column.
Spin at max speed (>20000g) for 2 minutes.
Add 500ul buffer AW2 to spin column.
Spin at max speed (>20000g) for 2 minutes.
Place spin column in a new collection tube and spin at max speed (>20000g) for 3 minutes.
Transfer spin column to a labeled 1.5ml Eppendorf lobind tube.
Add 100ul of buffer TE directly to membrane/filter in spin column and incubate at room temp.
