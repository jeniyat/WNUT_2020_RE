Cloning guides to lentiCRISPR v2
Digest the lentiCRISPRv2 vector: 3µg vector2µl 10X Tango buffer (Thermo Fisher)1µl 20mM DTT1-1.5µl Esp3I (Thermo Fisher)Water to 20µl
In  thermocycler:37°C for 4 hours, inactivate at 65°C for 20 mins, keep at 4°C
SKIP the alkaline phosphatase step.
Use a gel purification/PCR cleanup kit (Qiagen) WITHOUT running on a gel
Optional: run ~200ng of the purified vector on a gel to verify digestion.
Anneal and phosphorylate gRNA oligos pair:1µl of each oligo (100µM stock)1µl 10X T4 ligation buffer (not PNK buffer)0.5µl T4 PNKWater to 10µl
In  thermocycler: 37ºC for 30 mins, 95ºC for 5 mins, ramp down to 25ºC at 0.1ºC/sec (or 5-6ºC/min)
Optional: keep at 4ºC.
Serially dilute the annealed oligos to 1:500.
Out of ligation at a vector:insert molar ratios of 1:5, 1:10, 1:20.
I found that 1:5 works best
50ng vector1.5µl 10X T4 ligation buffer (NEB)1µl T4 ligase (NEB)2µl diluted oligos (1:500)Water to 15µlIncubate at RT for 1-2 hours.
Transform 5µl of the ligation reaction to 50µl Stbl3 chemically competent cells
If you incubate the Stbl3 cells at 30°C the colonies will be VERY small so look for them carefully.
Incubating them at 37°C didn't result in LTR recombination in my hands.
