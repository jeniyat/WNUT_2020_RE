EMP DNA Extraction Protocol
BEFORE THE FIRST USE ONLY, Solution C5-D must be prepared.
Add an equal amount of 100% Ethanol to Solution C5-D (for the 4 prep kit = 120 ml, or for the 12 prep kit = 360 ml).
Mix well.
Put a check mark in the “ethanol added” box on the bottle cap label.
Centrifuge Bead Plate for 1 min at 2500 x g to pellet the beads.
Remove the Square Well Mat from the PowerSoil®-htp Bead Plate and set aside.
Add 0.1 to 0.25 grams of soil sample or sample swab.
Add 750 μl of PowerSoil®-htp Bead Solution to the wells of the PowerSoil®-htp Bead Plate.
Check Solution C1.
If Solution C1 has precipitated, heat solution at 60°C until the precipitate has dissolved.
Add 60 μl of Solution C1.
Secure the Square Well Mat (from step 3) tightly to the plate.
Place sealed plates in 65°C water bath for 10 min.
DO NOT SUBMERGE THE PLATES.
Place PowerSoil®-htp Bead Plate between the aluminum plate adapters and securely fasten to the 96 Well Plate Shaker.
Shake at speed 20 for 20 minutes.
Centrifuge at room temperature for 6 minutes at 4500 x g.
While centrifuging, aliquot 250 μl of Solution C2 into each well of Plate #1 and cover with Sealing Tape.
Remove and discard the Square Well Mat from the Bead Plate
Carefully remove the Sealing Tape from Plate #1 and transfer the supernatant (~ 400-500μl) from the Bead Plate to Plate #1 and pipette up and down 4 times.
Re-apply the Sealing Tape to Plate #1.
Incubate at 4°C for 10 minutes.
Centrifuge Plate #1 at room temperature for 6 minutes at 4500 x g.
While centrifuging, aliquot 200 μl Solution C3 into each well of Plate #3, then cover with Sealing Tape.
After centrifugation, carefully remove and discard Sealing Tape from Plate #1.
Avoiding the pellet, transfer the entire volume (~600 μl depending on sample type) of supernatant in Plate #1 to Plate #2.
Apply Sealing Tape to Plate #2 and centrifuge at room temperature for 6 minutes at 4500 x g.
Carefully remove Sealing Tape from Plate #2 and Plate #3.
Avoiding the pellet, transfer the entire volume of supernatant (~600 μl) from Plate #2 to Plate #3 and pipette up and down 4 times.
Re-apply Sealing Tape to Plate #3.
Carefully remove and discard Sealing Tape from Plate #3.
Avoiding the pellet, transfer the entire volume of supernatant (~750 μl) to Plate #4.
Apply Sealing Tape to Plate #4 and centrifuge at room temperature for 6 minutes at 4500 x g.
While centrifuging, add 650 μl of Solution C4 to Plate #5.
Avoiding any residual pellet, transfer up to 650 μl of supernatant in Plate #4 to Plate #5.
Add a second 650 μl (1300 μl C4 total) aliquot of Solution C4 to each well of Plate #5.
Pipet samples “up and down” to mix.
Place Spin Plate onto Plate #6.
Load approximately 650 μl from Plate #5 into each well of the Spin Plate and apply Centrifuge Tape
Centrifuge at room temperature for 5 minutes at 4500 x g.
Discard the flow through and place the Spin Plate back on Plate #6.
Carefully remove and discard the Centrifuge Tape.
Repeat steps 30-32 until all the supernatant has been processed.
Discard the final flow through.
Place the Spin Plate back on Plate #6.
Confirm that ethanol has been added to Solution C5-D (see step 1).
Add 500 μl of Solution C5-D to each well of the Spin Plate.
Apply Centrifuge Tape to the Spin Plate.
Centrifuge again at room temperature for 6 minutes at 4500 x g.
Discard the flow through.
Carefully place the Spin Plate onto the Microplate.
Remove Centrifuge Tape from the Spin Plate and discard.
Add 100 μl of Solution C6 to the center of each well of the Spin Plate.
Apply Centrifuge Tape.
Let C6 sit on the filter for 10 minutes at room temperature before final centrifugation step.
Centrifuge at room temperature for 7 minutes at 4500 x g.
Remove Centrifuge Tape and discard.
Cover wells of Microplate with the Elution Sealing Mat provided.
DNA is now ready for any downstream application
No further steps are required.
