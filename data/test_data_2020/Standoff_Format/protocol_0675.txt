Intracellular Flow Cytometry Staining Protocol
If staining intracellular antigens (e.g. IFN-γ or IL-4), first perform cell surface antigen staining as described in BioLegend’s Cell Surface Immunofluorescence Staining Protocol, then fix cells in 0.5 ml/tube Fixation Buffer (BioLegend Cat. No. 420801) in the dark for 20 minutes at room temperature
Tip: For gentler fixation (particularly with tandem fluors), FluorFix™ Buffer (Cat. No.422101) can be used.
Centrifuge at 350 x g for 5 minutes, discard supernatant.
To put the experiment “on hold” at this point for future staining and analysis, wash cells 1x with Cell StainingBuffer (BioLegend Cat. No. 420201).
Resuspend cells in Cell Staining Buffer and store cells at 4°C (short term) or in 90% FCS/10% DMSO for storage at -80°C (long term, for fixed cells without surface antigen staining).
Dilute 10X Intracellular Staining Perm Wash Buffer (Cat. No. 421002) to 1X in DI water.
Resuspend fixed cells in Intracellular Staining Perm Wash Buffer and centrifuge at 350xg for 5-10 minutes.
Repeat step 5 twice.
Resuspend fixed/permeabilized cells in residual Intracellular Staining Perm Wash Buffer and add a predetermined optimum concentration of fluorophore-conjugated antibody of interest (e.g. PE anti-IFN-γ) or an appropriate negative control for 20 minutes in the dark at room temperature.
Wash 2x with 2ml of Intracellular Staining Perm Wash Buffer and centrifuge at 350xg for 5 minutes.
If primary intracellular antibody is biotinylated, it will be necessary to perform fluorophore conjugated Streptavidin incubations and subsequent washes in Intracellular Staining Perm Wash Buffer.
Resuspend fixed and intracellularly labeled cells in 0.5 ml Cell Staining Buffer and analyze with appropriate controls.
Dilute heparinized whole blood 1:1 with sterile appropriate tissue culture medium
Tip: For details on stimulation methods, please see our stimulation guide for cytokines/chemokines: (www.biolegend.com/media_assets/support_protocol/BioLegend_StimulationGuide_101711.pdf).
At this stage, in vitro cellular stimulation by either antigen or mitogen can be performed
If intending to stain intracellular cytokines or chemokines (e.g. IFN-γ or IL-4), addition of an efficient protein transport inhibitor such as brefeldin A or monensin is critical.
After addition of a suitable cellular activator, aliquot 200µl of the whole blood cell suspension into 12 x 75mm plastic tubes and incubate for 4-6 hours in 5% CO2at 37°C.
Add 2ml of 1X Red Blood Cell Lysis Buffer and incubate for 5-10 minutes at room temperature.
Centrifuge at 350xg for 5 minutes and discard the supernatant.
Wash cells 1X with Cell Staining Buffer and perform cell surface immunofluorescent staining as described above.
Fix, permeabilize, and stain intracellular antigens as described above.
Set PMT voltage and compensation using cell surface staining controls.
Set quadrant markers based on blocking controls, isotype controls, or unstained cells.
