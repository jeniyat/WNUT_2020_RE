How to make your protocol more reproducible, discoverable, and user-friendly
Title: Try to make your title descriptive, as you would for a manuscript.
This helps for searches on Google & protocols.io.
Thumbnail Picture: Having a picture to identify the protocol helps you and other users find it in the lists of protocols they use.
Groups: You can add your protocol to any relevant groups that you joined so that the members of these groups will receive a notification and be able to look at your protocol.
It will enable you to show your protocol to the right audience.
Keywords: When enter your protocol,  you can add keywords on the 'description' tab.
The keywords will be visible under the 'matadata' tab of you protocol and your protocol will appear in the search results for queries with these keywords.
Components: For each step you can add any of these components to provide the important details, by clicking on one of the boxes on the right side:.
Wetlab Components: Specifying the reagents and equipment with vendor names, catalog numbers, links, RRID, etc. is crucial.
Just naming the antibody you used is not enough, as vendor-to-vendor and even lot-to-lot variability can make or break the experiment.
Use the 'reagent' component inside steps or in the 'materials' section.
Bioinformatics Components: Use the "command", "software package", "dataset", and "external link"components to specify the code, version of software, and location/version of the datasets used in the analysis.
Pictures/Videos: You can add pictures or videos for any step of your protocol (or in the guidelines).
This often makes all the difference when someone is trying your method for the first time.
When doing an experiment, the protocols on this platform can be followed step-by-step on the web or on our iOS and Android apps.
Single Step Instructions: Break up the method details into recipe-like checklist format.
Instead of "incubate for 4min, then centrifuge at RT for 5min" separate as follows:.
Repeated Steps: Instead of "wash 3 times" or "repeat steps 8-13", spell out the individual steps
Be concise: Too much text in the instruction step makes it hard to follow.
Move comments and tips to the "annotation" component.
Timed steps: Use the "Duration/Timer" component in the individual steps as appropriate.
This makes it possible to use the timer when "running" your protocol
Running the protocol:.
Sections: Group related steps together into sections by giving sequential steps the same "section title".
Guidelines, warnings, before start: Use the "Guidelines & Warnings" tab for adding "before strart" instructions, warnings.
Also in "Guidelines & Warnings" tab is the "Guidelines" field for information about the method, references, tips, etc as well as an option to lable the protocol as confidential or containing sensetive content.
Safety: In the "Guidelines & Warnings" tab there is a "Safety Warings" field.
You can also add step-level safety information for specific reagents and equipment using the "Safety information" component.
It's good to be redundant with these warnings, so consider putting them into relevants steps, "warnings", and Guidelines.
