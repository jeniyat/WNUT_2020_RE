DNA extraction from gram negative bacteria for ONT MinION sequencing
1) Inoculate single bacterial colony into 2 ml of appropriate growth media2) Incubate overnight 37oC with shaking3) Transfer 1.5 ml of overnight culture into microfuge tube4) Pellet bacteria 5) Remove supernatantNOTEAt this stage bacterial pellet can be sored at -80oC for gDNA extraction at a later date with no compromise to extraction.
1) Dissolve lypholised RNase A American Bioanalytical #AB14043) in 50% glycerol and 10 mM Tris (pH 8.0) to a final concentration of 100 mg/ml(stock can be sorted at -20oC for future use)2) Dissolve lypholised Genfind proteinase K in Genfind proteinase K buffer to a final concentration of 96 mg/ml (stock can be sorted at -20oC for future use)3) For each bacterial ioslate to be extracted make a lysis master mix containing 400 ul Genfind lysis buffer, 9 ul Genfind proteinsae K and 1 ul RNase A (see step 1)4) Add 400 ul of the lysis master mix to each bacterial pellet5) Gently tip mix 10 times to enusre the bacterial pellet is well resuspended6) Incubate at 37oC for 30 minutes7) Procedd to DNA extraction.
1) Invert the Genfind binding buffer 20 times to ensure complete resuspension of the magnetic particles2) Add 300 ul of the Genfind binding buffer to each of the samples and gently tip mix 10 times, avoid generating bubbles
The magentic particles will most likely clump together at this stage due to the high concentration of DNA in the sample.3) Incubate samples at room temperature for 5 minutes4) Place the sample on a magentic rack for 5 minutes or until solution completely clears5) With the tubes on the magnet remove the supernatant avoiding the magentic particles6) Remove samples from the magnet7) Add 800 ul of Genfind wash buffer 1 to each of the samples8) Gently tip mix each sample 10 times
The idea is to try and resuspend the magentic beads but this will most likely not be possible as they will clump together
I try to make sure the clumps of beads move in and out of the pipette tip with each mix9) Place the sample on a magentic rack for 5 minutes or until solution completely clears10) Repeat steps 7-10 for a total of two washes with Genfind wash buffer 111) Add 500 ul of Genfind wash buffer 2 to each of the samples12) Gently tip mix each sample 10 times
I try to make sure the clumps of beads move in and out of the pipette tip with each mix13) Place the sample on a magentic rack for 5 minutes or until solution completely clears14) Repeat steps 11-13 for a total of two washes with Genfind wash buffer 215) Briefly centrifuge samples to bring all liquid to the bottom of the tube16) Place the sample on a magentic rack for 5 minutes or until solution completely clears17) Remove all traces of wash buffer 2 with a pipette, but do not allow beads to fully dry out.
18) Add 50-200 ul of 10 mM Tris pH 8.0 to each sample(I usually start with 100 ul but it will depend on the groth dynamics of your baccteria)19) Remove samples from the magnet20) Gently tip mix each sample 10 times and incubate at 37oC for 5 minutes then tip mix again
To ensure elution of DNA off the particles it is crucial that the magentic particles are completely resuspended
If it is not possble to entirle resuspend particles then add more 10 mM Tris.21) Place the sample on a magentic rack for 5 minutes or until solution completely clears22) Tranfer supenatant to a clean microfuge tube.
Try to avoid carryover of magnetic particles into the supernatant
NOTEAfter extraction DNA should be stored at 4oC to minimise any damage.
Storage at -20oC will result in ice crystal formation that will shear you DNA
I try to do my DNA extractions on the smae day as my library prep but have stored DNA at 4oC for a couple of weeks and still amde sucessful libraries.
1) Visualise sample to estimate the molecular weight.
We have a Fragment Analyzer and run a gDNA 1-60knp gel
Once you have extracted gDNA from the same species a number of times it is possibly not necessary to run a "gel" wiht each subsequent extraction.
However, I would run QC gels each time you tackle a new bacterial speices2) Quantify your sample with a fluorimter er.
