DroNc-seq step-by-step
Wash and filter barcoded beads (Chemgenes, Cat # Macosko-2011-10) as previously described.
Isolate beads smaller than 40 µm, using a 40 µm cell strainer (PluriSelect, Cat # 43-50040-03).
Suspend barcoded beads in Drop-seq Lysis Buffer.
Count beads at 1:1 dilution in 20% PEG solution, using a disposable Fuchs-Rosenthal hemocytometer (VWR, Cat # 22-600-102) and resuspend beads at concentrations ranging between 325,000 and 350,000 per ml.
Cell lines are cultured according to ATCC’s instructions.
For DroNc-seq, wash cells once with 1x PBS, scrape them with 2 ml nuclease- and protease-free Nuclei EZ lysis or EZ PREP buffer (Sigma, Cat # EZ PREP NUC-101) and process as tissues, described below.
Tissue samples may be flash-frozen on dry ice and stored at -80°C until they are processed for nuclei isolation.
To preserve tissue in RNAlater, samples are placed in ice-cold RNAlater (ThermoFisher Scientific, Cat # AM7020) and stored at 4°C overnight.
Remove RNAlater the following day and store samples at -80°C until processing.
Use either fresh, frozen or RNAlater fixed tissue or fresh cells as input material.
Prepare Nuclei Suspension Buffer (NSB; consisting of 1x PBS, 0.01% BSA (New England Biolabs, Cat # B9000S) and 0.1% RNAse inhibitor (Clontech, Cat #2313A)).
Dounce homogenize tissue samples (smaller than 0.5 cm) or cell pellets in 2 ml of ice-cold Nuclei EZ lysis buffer (Sigma, #EZ PREP NUC-101).
For brain tissue: grind 20-25 times with pestle A, followed by 20-25 times with pestle B (This may need to be modified for other tissues).
Move sample to a 15 ml conical tube, add 2 ml of ice-cold Nuclei EZ lysis buffer and incubate on ice for 5 minutes.
Collect nuclei by centrifugation at 500 x g for 5 minutes at 4°C.
Discard supernatant and carefully resuspend nuclei in 4 ml of ice-cold Nuclei EZ lysis buffer.
Incubate on ice for 5 minutes.
Resuspend isolated nuclei in 4 ml of NSB and collect nuclei by centrifugation at 500 x g for 5 minutes at 4°C.
Resuspend isolated nuclei in 1 ml of NSB, and filter through a 35 μm cell strainer (Corning, Cat # 352235).
Stain 10 µl of the single nuclei suspension with DAPI (Fisher, Cat # D1306), load on an NI hemocytometer, and count under a microscope.
A final concentration of 300,000 nuclei/ml is used for DroNc-seq experiments.
Proceed immediately to microfluidic droplet co-encapsulation.
Load the nuclei and barcoded bead suspension into 3 ml syringes (BD Scientific, Cat # BD309695) and connect to DroNc-seq microfluidic chip via 26G1/2 sterile needles (BD Scientific, Cat # BD305111) and PE2 tubing (Scientific Commodities, Inc.
Cat # BB31695-PE/2).
Flow both bead and nuclei suspensions at 1.5 ml/hr each, along with carrier oil (BioRad Sciences, Cat # 186-4006) loaded in 10 ml syringes (BD Scientific, Cat # BD309695) and flown at 16 ml/hr to co-encapsulate single nuclei and beads in ~75 µm drops at 4,500 drops/sec and double Poisson loading concentrations.
Collect resulting emulsion via PE2 tubing into a 50 ml Falcon tube for a period of ~22 min each, and incubate at room temperature for up to 45 min before proceeding to break droplets.
Emulsion collected after microfluidic co-encapsulation has the droplets cream to the top with clear oil collected under the droplets.
Carefully remove the excess clear oil, add 30 ml of 6x SSC (Teknova, Inc., Cat # S0282) into each 50 ml Falcon collection tube, agitate it vigorously, and add 1 ml of 1H,1H,2H,2H-Perfluorooctan-1-ol (SynQuest Laboratories, Cat # 647-42-7).
Vigorously shake the tubes by hand and centrifuge at 1,000 x g for 1 min.
Carefully remove the supernatant from each tube and squirt an additional 30 ml of 6x SSC to kick up the beads from the oil-water interface into the aqueous phase.
Remove the beads that were kicked up momentarily into the SSC with a 25 ml pipette and transfer them into a clean 50 ml Falcon tube, leaving the heavier oil behind.
Centrifuge the newly transferred beads and SSC mix again at 1,000 x g for 1 min; carefully remove the supernatant leaving ~1 ml of SSC and bead sediment behind.
Carefully transfer remaining SSC and bead mix into a 1.5 ml micro-centrifuge tube (Ambion, Cat # AM12450) and spin it down on a desktop micro-centrifuge for ~10 sec to generate a noticeable bead pellet.
Remove any residual oil that got transferred into the 1.5 ml tube with a p200 pipette with low-retention pipette tip.
Wash the beads again in 1.5 ml of 6x SSC.
Wash the beads again in 300 µl of 5x Maxima H- RT buffer (Fisher, Cat # EP0753).
A pellet of barcoded beads in each micro-centrifuge tube should have ~130,000 beads.
Make a fresh batch of 200 µl RT mix for each barcoded bead aliquot, consisting of: 80 µl H2O, 40 µl Maxima 5x RT Buffer, 40 µl 20% Ficoll PM-400 (Sigma, Cat # F5415-50ML), 20 µl 10 mM dNTP (Takara Bio, Cat # 639125), 5 µl RNase Inhibitor (Lucigen, Cat # 30281-2), 10 µl Maxima H-RT enzyme (Fisher, Cat # EP0753), and 5 µl 100 µM Template Switch Oligo, AAGCAGTGGTATCAACGCAGAGTGAATrGrGrG (IDT, custom RNA oligo, HPLC purification).
After the supernatant is carefully removed from each bead pellet, add 200 µl of the above RT mix into each tube, and incubate it under gentle rocking or tumbling for 30 min at room temperature, and then at 42°C for 1.5 hr in a rotisserie-style hybridization oven, for a total of two hours.
Post RT, each bead has cDNA barcoded with the bead’s unique barcode (BC) bound onto it, also referred to as a STAMP6.
