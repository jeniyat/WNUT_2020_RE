Neuro-2a cell culture (Neuro 2a, N2a)
For a T-75 flask:Remove and discard culture medium.
Briefly rinse the cell layer with 0.25% (w/v) Trypsin - 0.53 mM EDTA solution to remove all traces of serum that contains trypsin inhibitor.
Add 2.0 to 3.0 mL of Trypsin-EDTA solution to flask and observe cells under an inverted microscope until cell layer is dispersed (usually within 5 minutes).
Note: To avoid clumping do not agitate the cells by hitting or shaking the flask while waiting for the cells to detach.
Cells that are difficult to detach may be placed at 37Â°C to facilitate dispersal.
Add 10 mL of complete growth medium and aspirate cells by gently pipetting.
Pipett 10mL cell suspension through 60um filter into 40mL to achieve a 1:5 split.
Plate cells in appropriate vessel (T-75 flask or 6-well plate) and incubate at 37C.
Change media every 2 - 4 days.
Resubculture when cells are 70 - 90% confluent.
