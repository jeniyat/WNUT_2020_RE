Preparation of 1.5 mg/mL Sera-mag carbolylate modified magnetic particles
For a 500  mL final volume:Sera-mag carboxylate modified magnetic particles, 5% solids, 50 mg/mL (Hydrophobic) - 15 mLPEG-8000 - 110 gNaCl, 5 M - 100 mLTE, 100X - 5 mLTween 20 - 275 µL https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1s03EnedfadGRvxUioFEUlg6J3P8ue5SiLEO4yKHjQrE/edit#gid=0.
Weigh PEG, add to 1 L graduated cylinder, add NaCl solution, TE, and water to ~95 % of final volume.
If prep is bigger than 500 mL, be sure to use a graduated cylinder that is ≥ 2x the final volume.
Cover with parafilm.
Mix and stir on a magnetic stir plate until PEG is in solution, 5 - 30 minutes.
Add tween 20 and stir or mix gently to avoid foaming.
Wash Sera-mag beads in 1.5 mL aliquots in Eppendorf tubes, 2 times with 1.5 mLs of 1x TE.
For each wash, resuspend beads by pipetting.
For the final resuspension, use 1 mL of 1x TE for every 1.5 mL of beads washed.
Add washed beads to PEG solution, mix well.
Fill to 100% volume with water.
Mix until suspension is homogeneous.
Transfer to storage containers.
Store @ 4˚C.
Test new bead preparation compared to old and/or to AMPure XP beads as follows.
Prepare ≥ 200 uL of 100 ng/µL 50 bp ladder in 1x Tris-HCl.
Aliquot 10 µL of 100 ng/µL ladder into tubes.
Add reference and test bead preparations to 50 bp ladder at varied ratios.
Mix gently by pipetting up and down 10 times, by inverting tubes, or by slight vortexing
If droplets are stuck to sides of container, centrifuge quickly and gently.
Continue with Magnetic Particle Based DNA Purification  protocol from 1st incubation step.
Elute in 10 µL.
Check fragment patterns on an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer with a DNA 1000 kit.
Fragment pattern may not match commercial beads exactly at the lower (< 1.0) bead/sample ratios.
Fragment patterns at 1.0 bead to sample ratio and above should match.
