Cell Culture Transfection of HEK293 with cDNA and/or siRNA
One day prior to transfection, plate cells at a concentration of 500,000 cells per mL in a 12-well plate.
Modify the transfection spreadsheet (attached) to calculate how much cDNA/siRNA is needed for experimental conditions.
Make sure to include negative controls for the total amount of DNA or siRNA that is added.
Sterilize the biosafety cabinet with 10% bleach for 20 minutes.
Spray down the biosafety cabinet with 70% ethanol and use UV light for 15 minutes as a secondary decontaminant.
Three wells at a time, aspirate all media from plated cells with a sterile glass pipette.
Gently but quickly replace with 800 µL fresh warm complete DMEM, careful not to pipette vigorously enough to cause cells to detach.
According to the transfection spreadsheet, label master mixes in 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes for each triplicate condition.
First, add Opti-Mem to the master mix tubes.
Double check that concentrations of cDNA/siRNA match the transfection spreadsheet.
Mix thoroughly by flicking, then add the cDNA/siRNA to the Opti-Mem master mix tubes.
To the lipofectamine master mix: add lipofectamine to Opti-Mem, mix well, and then let the solution sit for 5 minutes.
Add the diluted lipofectamine to cDNA/siRNA at 1:1 ratio.
[+350 µL] Mix well.
Let solution sit for at least 20 minutes.
On the plated cells, label wells in triplicate for each treatment.
Be sure to number them to match the transfection spreadsheet.
Mix the Lipofectamine + Master Mix solution thoroughly and add 200 µL of each respective mix in a careful, dropwise circular motion.
Do not pipette directly on to cells in a stream
Mix the media with very gentle shaking, then return the cells to the incubator at 37°C and 5% CO2.
The next day, aspirate the old media three wells at a time and add 1 mL of warm complete DMEM media.
The following day, plan for cell lysis, protein assay, and gel sample preparation.
