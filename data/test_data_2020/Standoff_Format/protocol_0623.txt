Pool samples at equimolar concentrations and perform paired-end Illumina sequencing on the barcoded libraries following the manufacturer’s instructions.
We align paired-end reads using Bowtie2 version 2.2.5 with options: --local --very-sensitive- local --no-unal --no-mixed --no-discordant --phred33 -I 10 -X 700.
For mapping spike-in fragments, we also use the --no-overlap --no-dovetail options to avoid cross-mapping of the experimental genome to that of the spike-in DNA.
Scripts are available from https://github.com/Henikoff/Cut-and-Run for spike-in calibration and for peak-calling.
