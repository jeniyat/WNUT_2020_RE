Extraction of DNA from blood samples using QIAamp DNA mini kit (Qiagen)
Add 20µl of Qiagen protease in to a 1.5ml micro-centrifuge tube.
Add 200µl of whole blood into the same 1.5ml micro-centrifuge tube.
Add 200µl of buffer (AL) and mix by pulse vortexing for 15 seconds.
Incubate the solution in a water bath of 56 ºC for 10 minutes.
Then briefly centrifuge the tube to remove drops from the inside of the lid.
Add 200µl of ethanol (100%) to the sample and mix again by pulse vortexing for 15 seconds.
Then briefly centrifuge the mixure.
Then transfer the mixture carefully into a QIAamp mini spin column (in a 2 ml collection tube) without wetting the rim.
Close the cap and centrifuge the tube at 8000rpm for 1 minute.
Then place the QIAamp mini spin column in a clean 2 ml collection tube and discard the tube containing the filtrate.
Add 500µl of buffer (AW1) without wetting the rim and centrifuge at 8000 rpm for 1 minute after closing the cap.
Then place the QIAamp mini spin column in a clean 2ml collection tube and discard the tube containing the filtrate.
Add 500µl of buffer (AW2) without wetting the rim and centrifuge at 14,000 rpm for 3 minutes.
Then place the spin column in a new 2ml collection tube and discard the collection tube with the filtrate.
Centrifuge the spin column with the collection tube again at 14,000rpm for 1 minute.
Place the QIAamp mini spin column in a clean 1.5ml micro-centrifuge tube and discard the collection tube containing the filtrate.
Then add 200µl of elusion buffer (AE) and incubate at room temperature for 1 minute.
Then centrifuge the mixture at 8000rpm for 1 minute.
Discard the QIAamp mini spin column and store the micro-centrifuge tube containing the eluted DNA at -80°C.
