Vibrio natriegens - DNA transformation by electroporation
Use overnight culture corresponding to 1/100 of total media volume (For example, if you transform 6 samples you'll need a 600uL of overnight culture to inoculate 60ml media total).
Wash the cells as follows:Transfer the appropriate volume in eppendorf tube.
Pellet cells at max centrifuge speed for 1 minuteDispense supernatant
Resuspend cell pellet with same volume (i.e., 600uL) using fresh LB3 growth media.
Use the washed overnight cells to inoculate the appropriate volume of media and incubate the culture at 37C at 225rpm for 1 hour or until culture reaches OD600 ~ 0.4
Use a baffled flask with total volume greater than 2x the media (For example, use a 250mL flask for up to 100mL culture).
In the meantime, prepare electrocuvettes with 50ng of plasmid DNA and place on ice.
DNA volumen should not exceed 10ul.
Also prepare 10mL of cold 1M sorbitol, chilled to 4C and placed on ice.
With 10-15 minutes before the hour, prepare the cold centrifuges:Set large cold centrifuge to 4C by spinning at 3500rpm for 5min at 4C (for harvesting cells from culture media)
Set small cold centrifuge to 4C using “Fast Temp” setting (for eppendorfs).
Once culture has reached OD ~0.4,  centrifuge at 3500rpm for 5 minutes at 4C (50ml tubes).
Decant the supernatant, gently shaking to eliminate as much of the remaining media as possible.
Resuspend the pellet with 1mL of cold 1M sorbitol, transfer to eppendorf tube.
Pellet the cells at 4C at max speed for 1minute
Repeat sorbitol wash steps a total of 3 times
Resuspend the final cell pellet in 1/200th of the original culture volume.
(i.e., use 300uL for 60mL of cell culture)
Aliquot 50uL of concentrated cell solution into each electrocuvette (containing DNA)
To electroporate, wipe the outer surface of the electrocuvettes using kimwipe, place into the chamber and pulse with the following settings (BioRad electroporator)
Quickly, recover the cells by adding 1ml of LB3 media
Incubate recovery tubes for 45 minutes at 37C at 220rpm
Shorter incubation time is sufficient if large colony number is not required
During recovery, dry agar plates in the incubator (upside down).
Plate 100uL of the recovered culture on agar plate.
Plate the remaining 900uL of the recovered culture by transfering the remaining volume into an eppendorf tube, pelleting, removing all but ~100uL of the supernatant, resuspend and plate
Incubate overnight at 37C for colony formation.
Incubation at 30C or room temperature is also possible, yet slower.
