Chrome Azurol S (CAS) Liquid Assay for Iron-Binding Compounds
Take 6 mL 10 mM CTAB (HDTMA) stock and mix with 40 mL Milli-Q H2O.
Mix 1.5 mL FeCl3-HCl stock (1 mM FeCl3 dissolved in 10 mM HCl)Â with 7.5 mL 2 mM CAS dye stock.
Slowly add Fe-CAS mixture to CTAB solution while stirring.
Add 6.5 mL of 12 N HCl slowly to 25 mL Milli-Q H2O.
Add 4.3 g anhydrous piperazine to the acid solution.
Mix the piperazine acid solution slowly into the Fe-CAS*CTAB solution.
Bring CAS solution to 100 mL final volume.
Add enough 5-sulfosalicyclic acid to get 4 mM final concentration.
Take a sample to test and dilute it up to 0.5 mL final volume with Chelex-100 treated water.
Add 0.5 mL CAS solution.
Let sit 1 hr at room temperature in the dark.
For controls, your blank is 0.5 mL chelex-100 treated water.
A series of dilutions of EDTA can be used for a standard curve.
To measure the results, place the sample in a spectrophotometer and read the absorbance at 630 nm.
To graph/report the result, you calculate the absorbance of the blank/absorbance of the sample.
