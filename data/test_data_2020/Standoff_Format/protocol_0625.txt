Ultra-long read sequencing protocol for RAD004
Take 5x107 human cell pellet fresh or stored at -80°C in a 50 ml Falcon tube (for E. coli I used an overnight culture of E. coli growing in 50 ml LB broth spun down at 4500 x g for 10 minutes).
Resuspend by pipette mixing in 200 µl sterile PBS.
Add 10 ml TLB and vortex at full speed for 5 seconds.
Incubate at 37°C for 1 hour.
Add 100 µl Qiagen Proteinase K or other stock solution to a final concentration of 200 µg/ml.
Mix by slowly rotating end-over-end 3 times.
Incubate at 50°C for 2 hours, mix every 30 minutes by slowly rotating end-over-end 3 times.
Add light phase-lock gel to 2 x 15 ml Falcons.
If it is only available in 2 ml tubes, transfer it by cutting the lid off 3 x 2 ml tubes and spinning it out into each 15 ml Falcon.
Split the viscous lysate into the two 15 ml Falcon tubes prepared with phase-lock gel, this is easiest using a 10 ml serological pipette at slow speed.
Add 5 ml recently opened BioUltra TE-saturated phenol to each Falcon tube containing lysate.
Place on a HulaMixer at 20 rpm for 10 minutes, if a fine emulsion has not formed after a minute gradually increase the rotation speed.
Spin in a centrifuge at 4500 rpm for 10 minutes.
Pour the aqueous phases into two new 15 ml Falcon tubes containing phase-lock gel, try to avoid transferring any protein which may form a white layer above the phase-lock gel.
Add 2.5 ml buffer saturated phenol and 2.5 ml chloroform-isoamyl alcohol 24:1 to each tube.
Combine the aqueous phases from the two tubes by pouring slowly into a new 50 ml Falcon tube.
Add 4 ml 5 M ammonium acetate
Add 30 ml ice-cold ethanol and watch the DNA precipitate, bubbles will over time pull the mass of DNA to the surface so it looks like a Jellyfish with tentacles hanging down.
Make a hook by melting the tip of glass capillary in a blue flame so it curls over.
Hook out the DNA in one-piece if possible lift up and allow the excess liquid to drip off.
Submerge the DNA in a 50 ml Falcon tube containing 70% ethanol.
Carefully work the pellet off the glass rod using the rim of an Eppendorf tube, let the pellet drop into the tube.
Go back for the rest of the DNA if it broke apart and repeat.
Add 1 ml 70% ethanol to the Eppendorf.
Spin down at 10,000 xg then remove as much of the 70% ethanol as possible.
Wash again with 1 ml 70% ethanol.
Let the remaining ethanol evaporate by leaving at RT for 15 minutes.
Add 100 µl EB + Triton-X100 and incubate without mixing at 5°C for 2 days to allow the pellet to fully resuspend into a translucent viscous gel.
Take a P2 pipette set to 1.5 µl with a cut-off tip and aspirate very slowly then try to work the DNA in the tip away from the DNA in the tube by continuously pulling and releasing the DNA to work it gradually away.
Adjust the pipette volume to determine the volume of DNA you actually removed.
Quantify the DNA on the Qubit BR assay, the concentration should be >1 µg/µl, it is important to use BR as the buffer contains a detergent which appears to improve mixing.
Check the absorbance spectrum of the 1:10 diluted DNA on the NanoDrop, example trace below (ratios typically a little higher than other methods).
If necessary add more EB+Triton-X100 to the stock DNA to adjust concentration to 1 µg/ul but do not mix.
Leave overnight at 5°C before use.
As slowly as you can pipette 16 µl DNA into a 0.2 ml PCR tube using a cut-off P20 pipette tip, retain the tip.
Remove 1 µl from the tube as before and quantify using Qubit BR assay.
Add 1.5 µl FRA and 3.5 µl EB+Triton-X100
Using a P20 set to 18 µl and the tip from before, mix up and down as slowly as possible 8 times, retain the tip.
Using a thermocycler incubate at 30°C for 1 minute, 80°C for 1 minute then hold at 4°C.
Add 1 µl RAP.
Using a P20 set to 19 µl and the tip from before, mix up and down as slowly as possible 8 times, discard tip.
Incubate at room temperature while you prime the flowcell.
Add 30 µl FLT to tube of FLB, vortex briefly and spin down.
This is the flush mix.
Place new flowcell on MinION and run platform QC .
Using a P1000 remove a little storage buffer from the inlet port using the volume adjustment screw.
Load 800 µl flush mix via the inlet port slowly using the plunger.
Wait 5 minutes.
Lift the cover off the SpotON port.
Load 200 µl flush mix via the inlet port slowly using the plunger, try to dispense at a speed where a bead of liquid becomes visible over the SpotON port which then gets siphoned back in.
Add 34 µl SQT and 20 µl NFW to the library tube.
Using a P100 set to 75 µl with a cut-off tip mix up and down as slowly as possible 5 times.
On the final mix slowly pipette the diluted library onto the SpotON port as it gets siphoned in, this can take much longer than usual due to the viscosity.
See guidelines for expected results.
