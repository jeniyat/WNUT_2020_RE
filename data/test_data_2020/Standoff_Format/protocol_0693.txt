Single-cell RNA extraction and cDNA library preparation from challenging marine protists (e.g. Acantharea)
Collect your favorite marine protists with the plankton net of your choice.
We use a 100 μm-mesh-size Rigo simple net (20 cm diameter).
Observe plankton samples under a dissecting microscope.
Isolate individual protists with a pulled-glass micropipette connected to an aspirator (Sigma) with silicone tubing and a 0.45 μm filter.
Transfer protists to small, clean petri dishes while including the smallest volume of seawater possible
Use a sterile dropper to add 0.2 μm-filter sterilized seawater to rinse the isolated protists
Repeat transfers and rinses until the protists of interest are clean and free of contaminants.
Image the protist as desired
Allow protists to self-clean for 0.5–2 hr.
Use the glass micropipette to transfer the protist to an Axygen maxymum recovery PCR tube including the smallest volume of seawater possible.
Aspirator and glass micropipette set-up: Place the PCR tube under the dissecting microscope to ensure that the protist of interest is indeed in the tube.
Add 30 μL of Qiagen RLT+ Buffer (with 1% β-mercaptoethanol) to the sample tube.
Place sample in small plastic zip-locked bag along with a sample label (pencil on water-proof paper), and submerge sample in liquid nitrogen.
Store samples at −80 °C until ready to proceed with RNA extraction.
Representative acantharians used in this protocol: (scale bar is 100 μm)(scale bar is 50 μm).
Allow Agencourt RNAClean XP beads to reach room temperature by removing from the refridgerator at least 30 minutes before use.
Allow frozen samples to thaw over ice.
Vortex each sample 2x for 10 sec at speed 7 on a Vortex-Genie 2.
Gently spin each sample to collect liquid at the bottom of the tube
Incubate each sample at room temperature for 5 min.
Determine the volume of each sample using a micropipette (set the pipette to 50 μL and draw up the entire sample, decrease the volume of the pipette until there is no air remaining between the sample and the opening of the pipette tip and record the final volume).
Vortex room temperature Agencourt RNAClean XP magnetic beads.
Add beads to each sample at a 2.2:1 v:v ratio (multiply the volume of each sample by 2.2 to determine the volume of magnetic beads to add).
Thoroughly mix each sample by pipetting the entire volume (sample + beads) up and down at least 10 times.
Incubate samples with RNAClean XP beads at room temperature for 30 min to fully bind the RNA to the beads.
Place samples on magnetic stand until sample appears clear (2–5 min).
Using a multichannel pipette, remove the clear supernatant from all samples without disturbing the beads.
Discard the supernatant.
Fill a sterile, nuclease-free disposable reservoir with 80% ethanol (etOH) in nuclease free water.
With a multichannel pipette, add 200 μL of 80% etOH to each sample without disturbing the beads.
With a multichannel pipette, remove the 80% etOH from all samples and discard.
With a multichannel pipette, again add 200 μL of 80% etOH to each sample.
Remove samples from the magnetic stand and gently spin to collect all remainig etOH.
Place samples back on the magnetic stand and use a 10 μL pipette tip to remove all remaining etOH from each sample.
Dry the magnetic beads by leaving the sample caps open and watching the bead pellets carefully.
As the bead pellets lose their sheen and begin to appear matte, close the sample lids to prevent over drying.
Elute the RNA from the magnetic beads.
As soon as beads are dry (before cracks appear in the bead pellet), add 11 μL of elution buffer to samples.
The elution buffer contains 10.72 μL of nuclease-free water and 0.28 μL of RNase inhibitor per samplePipette the elution buffer over bead pellets until the pellet breaks up in the elution buffer.
After elution buffer has been added to all samples, mix the samples by pipetting up and down 10 times to further resuspend beads (they do not need to be fully resuspended)
Gently spin samples to collect the eluate.
Place the samples back on the magnetic stand until the samples appear clear.
Collect eluted RNA by aspirating 10.5 μL of each sample, without disturbing the beads, and tranfer eluted RNA to clean low-bind PCR tubes.

Typically, the cDNA concentration is always less than 10 ng/μL which is the maximum input for the High Sensitivity DNA assay.
If the cDNA concentration is more than 0.5 ng/μL, you may dilute samples by 1/2 or 1/10
Follow the manufacturer's protocol for the Agilent Bioanalyzer High Sensitivity DNA assay.
https://www.agilent.com/cs/library/usermanuals/Public/G2938-90322_HighSensitivityDNA_QSG.pdf.
Dilute cDNA to 0.2 ng/μL per sample using the formula C1V1 = C2V2 with C1 equal to the concentration measured with Qubit and, C2 equals 0.2 ng/μL, and V2 is 6 μL.
Solve for V1 and add V1 of sample to V2 − V1 μL of nuclease free water.
Use 1 μL to check the concentration of the diluted cDNA with the Qubit 3.0 HS DNA assay.
Follow the manufacturer's protocol for the Nextera XT DNA Library Prep Kit to prepare sequencing libraries.
Perform manual normalization of sequencing libraries (do not use bead normalization).
Quantify libraries with Qubit 3.0 and determine the average library size (fragment length) with the Bioanalyzer High Sensitivity DNA assay.
Use both the library concentration and average library size to calculate the molarity of libraries in nM and then dilute accordingly before pooling the sequencing libraries.
