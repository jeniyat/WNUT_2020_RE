RNA extraction for plant samples using CTAB-pBIOZOL
To make the 2x CTAB buffer used in the pre-lysis step make up the following b and then autoclave and aliquot.
2% CTAB (w/v)                           20g100mM Tris(PH 8.0 , 1M)           100ml20mM EDTA(PH 8.0, 0.5 M)       40ml1.4 M NaCl                                  81.8gThen add distilled water to make it up to 1000ml.
Add 750µl 2x CTAB buffer to 60µl of beta-mercaptomethanol and 750µl pBIOZOL reagent in 2ml eppendorf tubes.
Mix well.
Warm up the lysis buffer to 65°C in a heat block.
Cut 1-2 cm² sections of plant or leaf tissues and grind up in a pestle and mortar with liquid nitrogen.
These roughly 80mg samples are then added into the warmed 1.5ml aliquots of CTAB-pBIOZOL lysis buffer.
Incubate the samples in a thermo mixer with gentle mixing (700rpm) for 15 minutes at 65°C to permit the commplete dissociation of nucleoprotein complexes.
Save.
After incubation centrifuge at 12000xg for 5 minutes at 4°C.
Transfer the supernatant to a new 2.0ml eppendorf tube.
Add 400µl chloroform per 1.5ml of CTAB-pBIOZOL reagent.
Shake the tubes vigourously for 15s, then centrifuge again at 12000xg for 10 minutes at 4°C.
Transfer the supernatant to new tubes.
Add 700µl acidic phenol and 200µl chloroform.
Shake the tubes vigourously for 15 seconds and centrifuge for 12000xg for 10 minutes at 4°C.
Following centrifugation the mixture should seperate into three layers: the phenol chloroform phase, an interphase, and an upper aqueous phase.
The RNA remains in the aqueous phase, and if you want to extract DNA later this is in the interphase.
Transfer the aqueous phase into a new 2.0ml tube and add an equal amount of chloroform
Transfer the supernatant to a new 1.5ml tube and add an equal volume of isopropyl alcohol.
Mix well and then leave at -20°C for 2 hours to precipitate.
Centrifuge at 13600rpm for 20 minutes at 4°C.
Carefully remove the supernatant and wash the pellet with 1ml of 75% ethanol.
Re-suspend the sample and centrifuge at 13600rpm for 3 minutes at 4°C.
Repeat the washing step, removing the supernatant, adding 1ml of fresh 75% ethanol, resuspending the pellent, and then centrifuging again at 13600rpm for 3 minutes at 4°C.
Completely remove the ethanol without disturbing the pellet, and then air-dry in the biosafety cabinet.
Do not overdry the pellet or you won't be able to redissolve it.
Once dry you can resuspend in DEPC-treated water to disolve the pellet (note: DEPC inhibits RT reaction).
Use 30-50µl of water depending on the concentration needed.
To discolve properly you may need to pipet up and down, and heat to 55-60°C for 10 min.
