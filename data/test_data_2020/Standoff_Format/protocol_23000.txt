Preparation and storage of reagents
Stock reagents for PCR (10X buffer, dNTPs, MgCl2, Q solution and primers) and enzymes should be stored at -20°C.
Stock reagents should be diluted into working concentrations and aliquoted at -20°C into separate tubes.
Working aliquots of sample and control DNA as well as primary PCR (Nest-1) products must be kept at -20°C for long-term storage but can be kept in the fridge for daily use.
PCR summary protocol 
Primary PCR/ Nest-1 PCR should be done using PolEF and PolER  primers.
For each group of samples include positive control (DNA from MT2 cell line) and a negative control of PCR mix without a DNA template.
Nest-2 PCR should be done using the primers PolIF and PolIR.
Also the primers Actin F and Actin R are necessary to amplify human Actin gene.
Once the PCR run is complete, remove tubes and briefly centrifuge to spin down products.
Store PCR tubes in the fridge or freezer
Run the samples on 2% Agarose gel electrophoresis using gel red nucleic acid stain.
Score results as presence or absence of bands comparing with control bands. 
PCR Protocol
For each run, at least two controls (1 positive and 1 negative) should be included in addition to the samples. 
Prepare the PCR master mix calculating enough volume for number of the samples +8%, to account for pipetting loss and dead volume.
