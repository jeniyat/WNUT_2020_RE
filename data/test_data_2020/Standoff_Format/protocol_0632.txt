RNA Isolation from Yeast
Centrifuge 10 – 15 ml of yeast cells in a 15-ml conical tube at 1,500 rcf (room temperature) for 3 min
Decant supernatant and freeze cells in liquid nitrogen.
To frozen cell pellet, add 800 µl of acid saturated phenol and 800 µl of lysis buffer
Vortex until pellets are in solution.
 Place tubes in MultiTherm (should be pre-heated to 65°C)
Vortex at maximum intensity for 45 min at 65°C.
Transfer lysate to RNase-free 2-ml tube
Centrifuge 10 min at max speed in microcentrifuge at 4°C
Transfer top aqueous phase into fresh RNase-free 2-ml tube containing 800 µl phenol
Vortex briefly and centrifuge 5 min at 5,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge at room temperature
Transfer top aqueous phase into fresh RNase-free 2-ml tube containing 800 µl chloroform
Vortex briefly and centrifuge 5 min at 5,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge at room temperature
Transfer aqueous phase into fresh RNase-free 2-ml tube.
Add 75 µl 3 M NaOAc pH 5.2 (0.1 volume) and ~ 1.8 ml 100% ethanol (~2.5 volumes)
Place tubes at -20°C to precipitate RNA for >2 hours (overnight works best).
 Next Day Pellet RNA at max speed for 30 min in microcentrifuge at 4°C
Carefully decant supernatant and add 1 ml 70% EtOH to wash pellet
Centrifuge at max speed for 15 min at 4°C
Remove ethanol using a 1-ml pipette (use RNase-free pipette tips)
Centrifuge briefly (1-2 min) at max speed to collect any residual ethanol to the bottom of the tube and remove that with a 10-ul pipette (use RNase-free pipette tips)..
Next Day Pellet RNA at max speed for 30 min in microcentrifuge at 4°C
Carefully decant supernatant and add 1 ml 70% EtOH to wash pellet
Centrifuge at max speed for 15 min at 4°C
Remove ethanol using a 1-ml pipette (use RNase-free pipette tips)
Centrifuge briefly (1-2 min) at max speed to collect any residual ethanol to the bottom of the tube and remove that with a 10-ul pipette (use RNase-free pipette tips)..
Resuspend pellet in 50 µl RNase-free TE by pipetting up and down.
