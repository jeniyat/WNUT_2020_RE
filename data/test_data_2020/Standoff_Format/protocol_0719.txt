Algal nuclei isolation for Nanopore sequencing of HMW DNA
Add BME to premade NIB.
Per sample add  BME into  premade NIB.
Make 10% Triton X-100 NIB solution.
Per sample, aliquot  NIB prepared in previous step and add  Triton X-100.
Cool solutions to  on ice.
Set thermomixer to.
Chill centrifuge to.
Chill 50 ml conical tubes (4 per sample) and NIB buffers on ice.
Transfer  to   of culture to a pre-chilled 50 ml conical tube and centrifuge   at  for   to pellet cells
The amount of culture spun down as well as the centrifugation speed at which cultures are pelleted should be optimized for each organism.
In our experience, the pellet size should be at least the size of a lentil for small (5 μm) for our alga.
Discard the supernatant and snap freeze the conical tube in liquid nitrogen for at least  
Some organisms will require some type of tissue disruption to lyse cells.
Place cell pellet on ice and add   of ice cold NIB
If you know your pellet is not very soluble, only add 1mL of NIB at first and mix by pipetting up and down with a 1mL pipette.
Add remaining 9mL NIB after clumps are broken up.
Mix by slowly pipetting up and down with a 10mL serological pipettor until the mixture is smooth and not clumpy.
Place a 100 μm filter on top of a pre-chilled 50 ml conical tube.
Slowly pour the sample through the filter into the clean tube
Use a serological pipettor to wash the filter with  of ice cold NIB.
Place a 70 μm filter on top of a second pre-chilled 50 ml conical tube.
Place a 40 μm filter on top of a third pre-chilled 50 ml conical tube.
(Do not wash with NIB).
Add  of ice cold NIB + TritonX solution to filtrate.
Centrifuge   at  for  to pellet nuclei
The speed at which the sample is spun down should be reevaluated for different organims based on genome size.
Discard the supernatant.
Aliquot  of the pellet into a clean 1.5ml eppendorf tube.
Add  of fresh NIB and   of propidium iodide to the tube.
Transfer the stained nuclei to a microscope and confirm presence of fluorescing nuclei under an epifluorescent light
Image was taken on a Nikon Ts2R-FL microscope with a CFP LP cube (Excitation 448/23nm (436.5-459.5nm), Emission 472nm Long Pass).
