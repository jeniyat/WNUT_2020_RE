Grind tissue/spores with liquid nitrogen in a mortar with sand, use 1g of sand per 100mg of starting material.
Grind for 2 mins in 4x 15 sec bursts adding liquid nitrogen after each 15 sec grinding burst.
Transfer ground tissue with sand into 50mL Falcon containing lysis buffer.
Add 10 uL of RNAse A and 100 uL of Proteinase K and mix by inversion until no clumps are visible.
Incubate in rotator at 30 rpm for 30 min at RT.
Cool in ice for 5 minutes.
Add 2.8 mL (0.2 vol) of KAc 5M, mix by inversion, incubate on ice for max 5 mins.
Spin at 4°C and 5000g for 12 mins.
Transfer supernatant to fresh Falcon tube containing 17 mL (~1vol) (P:C:I) and mix by inversion.
Transfer supernatant to a new 50 mL falcon and add 10 µL of RNAse A.
Add 100 µL of Proteinase K and incubate in rotator at 30 rpm for 30 min at RT.
Add 1 vol (17mL) of P:C:I, mix by inversion and spin at 4°C and 5000g for 12 minsSolution will look milky like this
After centrifugation, there should be little to no debris in the aqueous layer, as in here.
Transfer supernatant to a new 50 mL falcon and add 0.1 vol (~1.5 mL) of NaAc and mix by inversion.
Add 1 vol (~ 17 mL) of cold isopropanol and mix well by inversion.
Spin at 4°C and 8000g for 30 mins.
Pour off supernatant, keeping around 1 mL.
Use it to dislodge the pellet and transfer it to a 1.5 mL tube
Spin in a microcentrifuge at 15 000g for 3 min.
Discard supernatant and add 1 mL of cold 70% ethanol, flick the tube to help wash the pellet and spin in a microcentrifuge at 15 000g for 3 min.
Discard the supernatant, spin again to get the remaining ethanol out.
Air dry the pellet for 1 min.
Add 200 μL of 10mM Tris pH 8.5 and flick the tube to dislodge the pellet
Let it dissolve over night
Measure concentration with BR Qubit and absorbance with Nanodrop.
Vortex AMPure beads and add 0.6 vol of beads to the DNA sample.
Mix beads and DNA by flicking the tube
DO NOT VORTEX BEAD/DNA MIXTUREIncubate in a rotator 30 rpm for 10min.
Spin the beads/DNA mix for 1-2 sec in a microcentrifuge or table top centrifuge.
Place the tube on a magnetic rack.
Wait for the beads to pellet against the magnet
Slowly pipet off the supernatant.
Wash beads with fresh cold 70% ethanol,  using enough volume to fill the tube.
Pipette the ethanol in the tube on the wall opposite of the bead pellet.
Pipette off ethanol and repeat wash.
Remove from magnet and spin the beads for 1-2 sec in a microcentrifuge or table top centrifuge.
Place back on the magnet and let the bead pellet stick.
(Should be very quick 1-2 secs)Pipette off the remaining ethanol.
Do NOT let the ethanol dry.
Take the tube from the rack and add 49 µL of nuclease-free water and flick the tube to ressuspend the beads.
Incubate at 37°C for 5 min.
Spin the tube and place it at the magnetic rack.
Wait for the beads to pellet and recover supernatant.
