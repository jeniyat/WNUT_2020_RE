HotSHOT DNA extraction
Add 50ul of alkaline lysis solution into 0.2ml PCR tubes, or 96 well PCR plate, and add tissue
Solutions are detailed in the Description section
The volume of solution and tissue are the major determinant of how well your DNA extraction will work.
Too much tissue is the most common cause of PCR failure following HotSHOT.
Sub-visible amounts up to tissue the size of a full stop .
try 25ul.
Tissue the size of a 10pt Arial font o might need 75ul.
Begin by trying a few tissue to solution ratios until you are familiar.
Too much tissue is the most common cause of failure for HotSHOT beginners.
Incubate at 95°C for 30 minutes (in a PCR machine).
Add 50ul (an equal volume) of neutralizing solution.
Store at 4°C or -20°C for long periods.
Use 1-5ul in a PCR reaction.
