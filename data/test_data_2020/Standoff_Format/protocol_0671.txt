Basic Cell Culture Maintenance: Plating Cells
Split cells following the Basic Cell Culture Maintenance: Splitting Cells protocol.
Cells leftover from split flasks will be used to count and plate cells.
Add 75 μL media and 25 μL leftover cells into a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.
(1:4 dilution).
Mix thoroughly by flicking.
Load 10 μL into the hemacytometer and view under microscope.
Count cells per quadrant.
Average them.
Multiply by 10,000 and the dilution factor (4).
Calculate amount of cells + new media needed to create a master mix using C1V1, in which concentration is cells per mL/cells per well.
(one well = 1 mL) Add 3 more wells of volume than needed to calculations to account for errors.
Create master mix in 50 mL falcon tube.
Invert master mix several times just before plating to ensure it is evenly mixed.
Label plates with strain, date, and initials.
Add 1 mL master mix to each well.
Gently mix plates with gentle shaking.
Return the cells to the incubator at 37°C and 5% CO2.
