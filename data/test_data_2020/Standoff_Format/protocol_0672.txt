Denaturing formaldehyde agarose gel-electrophoresis
10x MEN buffer: 200 mM MOPS, 50 mM NaOAc, 10 mM EDTA, pH = 7.0FormaldehydeUltra pure waterAgarose.
Recipe for one 100 mL gel (e.g. PeqLab Mini L electrophoresis chamber):Assemble gel chamber with suitable comb
Heat 1.3 g in 85 mL ultra pure water.
Let cool
Under the hood, quickly add 10 mL 10x MEN buffer and 5 mL formaldehyde and pour gel.
For Northern Blot Analysis, 1-3 µg of RNA should be loaded per well
Adjust concentration and volume of all RNA samples by adding RNase-free ddH2O.
Add equal amounts of 2x RNA Loading Dye
Denature RNA at 95˚C for 5 min.
Snap cool on ice.
Add 1x MEN to the chamber (running buffer).
Make sure wells are covered in buffer
Load RNA
Separate RNA at 5-6 V/cm for at least 30 minutes or longer, if desi.
Document the gel using the BioRad ChemiDoc MP Imaging System
Use either the GelRed or the Ethidium bromide protocol.
