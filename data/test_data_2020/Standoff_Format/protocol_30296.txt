Respiratory picornavirus genotyping conventional nested RT-PCR ("Wisdom VP42 assay")
Expected amplicon sizes:
Round 1:
~380 base pairs;
Round 2: 
The naming used here is my in-house adaptation (FYI: 01 - forward / sense; 02 - reverse / antisense; .x - version of the design of this particular named oligonucleotide).

ROUND 1 REACTION MIX
Ideally, set up more reaction mixes than you'll need for both rounds at the same time
Strips of 8x 0.2ml tubes are good for this use
Freeze in a frost-free freezer at -20°C until needed
Dispense 18µL into each reaction tube 
Total reaction volume will be 20µl
This reaction has been run using a SimpliAmp (Applied Biosystems) thermal cycler
Transfer 5µl of nucleic acid extract (extracted RNA, controls or NTC [nuclease-free water]) to defrosted reaction tubes and cycle
Transfer 2µl of 1:100 pre-diluted Round 1 amplicon into defrosted 0.2ml reaction tubes and cycle
