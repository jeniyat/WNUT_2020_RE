Preparation of chemically competent cells
Required:Ice, sterile 1.5 mL tubes (label before starting), pre-cooled centrifuge100 mM CaCl2, glycerol, both sterile85 mM CaCl2 with 15% glycerol!!!
Always work under sterile conditions to avoid contamination !!!.
Inoculate a 5 ml overnight-culture in LB-medium without antibiotics (for DH5a) or with appropriate antibiotics (for other strains)
Grow over night at 37 ˚C at 250 rpm.
Inoculate 100 ml LB-medium with 1/100 volume of the overnight culture and incubate to an OD600 = 0.5 - 0.6 at 37 °C and 230 rpm.
Transfer cells to two sterile 50 ml falcon tubes and incubate on ice for 20 min
From this step on, always keep cells cold.
Centrifuge for 5 min at 4500 rpm and 4 °C (pre-cool centrifuge) and discard the supernatant.
Carefully suspend each pellet in 20 ml of ice-cold 100 mM CaCl2 and incubate on ice for 1 h.
Carefully suspend each pellet in 2 ml icecold 85 mM CaCl2 containing 15% Glycerol.
Pipette 50 - 200 µl aliquots in prepared, pre-cooled 1.5 ml tubes (work on ice), shock-freeze in liquid nitrogen or on dry ice and store at -80 °C
For DNA transformation, thaw competent cells on ice.
