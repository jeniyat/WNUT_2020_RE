Transcardally perfuse a mouse with cold oxygenated artificial spinal fluid solution.
Quickly dissect out the brain on a cold surface.
Place the brain in cryomold and fill it up with Tissue-Tek O.C.T. (Sakura).
Snap freeze the sample by lowering the cryomold in a slush of isopentane and dry ice.
Make sure to prepare the slush before dissection and wait to use it until the bubbling stops.
Store sample at -80°C.
Empty a box of coverslips (#1.5) in a beaker.
Rinse coverslips in distilled water two times for 20 min.
Incubate the coverslips in concentrated nitic acid for 24 hours.
Rinse coverslips in water 4 times for 1 hour.
Fill the beaker with distilled water and sterilize the coverslips by autoclaving.
Wash coverslips once with 95% ethanol and store them indefinitively in 95% ethanol.
Place the coverslips to use in a rack and air dry to remove the ethanol.
Prepare 2% (3-Aminopropyl)triethoxysilane, APS (v/v)(Sigma) in acetone in a staing jar.
Make sure to use fresh APS that has been stored in a dry environment
Dip the rack with the coverslips for 1 minute in the solution, followed by a 1 minute dip in RNAse free water.
Air dry the coverslips and store them in a dessicated envirionment
Cryocut 10µm thick sections of the fresh frozen tissue and mount the section on the functionalized coverslips.
In order to remove the electostatic charge of the coverslip clean one side of the coverslip with a kimwipe wetted with ethanol.
Make a fixing chamber by cutting a hole in a piece of parafilm and place it in a petri dish.
The parafilm functions as a spacer to separate the tissue section from the bottom of the petri dish.
The number of chambers matchs the number of sections that will be cut.
Place a drop of 4% PFA in the a clean petri dish inside the hole in the parafilm.
Directly after capture, fix the section with 4% PFA for 10minutes by placing the tissue section face down on the PFA drop.
SuggestionWe saw that PFA soultion prepared from powder causes lower background compared to commercial PFA solutions.
However, we didn't test all the solutions available in the market.
After fixation transfer the glass to a clean petri dish and rinse twice with PBS.
Remove the excess of PBS and dry the slide with a tissue without touching the tissue.
Dehydrate the slide in >1ml of isopropanol for 3 minutes.
Followed by air drying.
Store the slide at -80°C untill use.
Assemble the sample in the flow cell
We use a custom flow cell that was manufactured by Microliquid.
A flow cell facilitates the automation.
Please see our notes on the osmFISH website.
Rehydrate the tissue for 5 minutes with 2X SSC buffer.
Clear the tissue by incubating the tissue with 4% SDS in 200mM boric-acid pH 8.5 4 times for 5 minutes
Wash the section with SSC 2X 5 times.
Wash the tissue twice with Tris EDTA buffer pH 8.
Perform a heat shock by placing the sample at 70°C for 10 min.
Promptly wash 3 times with SSC 2X.
Incubate the tissue with hybridization mix without probes for 5 minutes at room temperature.
Hybrization mix without probes:2X SSC (Sigma)10% (w/v) Dextran sulfate (Sigma)10% (v/v) Formamide (Ambion)1 mg/ml E. coli tRNA (Roche)2mM Ribonucleoside vanadyl complexes (RVC) (Sigma)0.2 ml/ml Bovine Serum Albumin (Sigma).
Incubate the tissue with hybridization mix with probes for 4 hours at 38.5°C.
Hybrization mix with probes:2X SSC (Sigma)10% (w/v) Dextran sulfate (Sigma)10% (v/v) Formamide (Ambion)1 mg/ml E. coli tRNA (Roche)2mM Ribonucleoside vanadyl complexes (RVC) (Sigma)0.2 ml/ml Bovine Serum Albumin (Sigma)250nM Probes (Sellaris, LGC Biosearch technologies).
~48 probes/target.
The final concentration of each probe set needs is 250nM.
Wash 4 times 15 minutes with 20% formamide in 2X SSC at 38.5°C.
Add a nuclear staining (ex. Hoechst, Dapi) if needed.
Wash with 2X SSC.
Inject Slow Fade Diamond imaging buffer (Thermo).
Do not use hardening mounting media in the flow cell.
You can use hardening mountine media if the coverslips will be mounted on a slide before imaging.
Perform imaging of the region of interestIt is important to save the field of views that are imaged in order to repeat the imaging of the same region.
For an extensive discussion on the imaging setup and repeated imaging of the same tissue section please see our website.
Wash 5 times with SSC 2X to remove the mounting media.
Strip the probes off of their targets by washing 3 times 10 minutes with 65% formamide in 2X SSC at 30°C.
Wash 5 times with SSC 2X.
Optional: verify if the signal is stripped by imaging.
Incubate the tissue with Hybridization mix without probes for 5 minutes at room temperature.
Incubate the tissue with Hybridization mix with probes for 4 hours at 38.5°C.
coli tRNA (Roche)2mM Ribonucleoside vanadyl complexes (RVC) (Sigma)0.2 ml/ml Bovine Serum Albumin (Sigma)250nM Probes per target (Sellaris, LGC Biosearch technologies).
Wash 4 times 15 minutes with 20% formamide in 2X SSC at 38.5°C.
Perform imaging of the region of interest.
Repeat the "osmFISH Repeat Round" (Steps 33-42) untill all targets have been labeled.
