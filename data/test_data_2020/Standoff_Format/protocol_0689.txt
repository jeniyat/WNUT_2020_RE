High molecular weight DNA extraction after Bolger et al.
Prepare extraction buffer, nuclear buffer and TE buffer to cool it down to 4 °C.
Harvest 50 g of young leaves into 1 L ice cold TE buffer (pH 7).
Transfer leaves into pre-chilled Waring blender and add 600 mL lysis buffer *steps 3-6 were carried out in 4 °C temperature room.
Homogenise in 15 s bursts for a total of 1 min and 15 s   (homogenising times may vary due to plant material, shorter times could lead to more full nuclei but lower yield).
Transfer plant material to Miracloth (filtrationmaterial for homogenates) and squeeze through 4 layers and further gravity filter through 8 layers of Miracloth.
Add 10% (v/v) Triton X-100 to the homogenate to a final concentration of 0.5% (v/v).
Incubate mixture on an ice bath with gentle rocking for 30 min.
Discard supernatant.
Gently resuspend the pellet using a normal painters brush (not used and optimaly sterilised before), soaked in freshly made pre-chilled nuclear buffer.
Add sufficient nuclear buffer to bring the volume up to 10 mL.
Centrifuge at 600 g and 4 °C for 20 minutes.
Repeat washing steps 9-12 twice more (until the pellet becomes grey-white and no traces of green are visible anymore).
Gently resuspend the pellet using a brush soaked in nuclear buffer and add sufficent nuclear buffer to bring volume up to 5 mL.
Incubate at 60 °C for 10 mins and then let cool down on bench to RT.
Add 5 M sodium perchlorate to a final concentration of 1 M.
Add an equal volume of phenol/chloroform/isoamylalcohol (25:24:1) to the tube.
Mix on a rotor for 10 mins.
Centrifuge at 3000 g and 22 oC for 10 mins.
Transfer the upper phase to a new tube and discard lower phase
Repeat steps 20-23.
Repeat steps 20-23 twice more but only using chlorofom/isoamylalcohol (24:1).
Precipitate DNA by adding 2x volume of ice cold ethanol and gently invert several times.
Transfer the pellet to an 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube and allow the Ethanol to evaporate for approx. 5 mins (depends on the size of the pellet, but if the pellet dries out completely it might be difficult to dissolve the DNA again).
Meassure dsDNA concentration using Qubit and meassure absorbance using Nanodrop  (because of the high concentration you might want to make e.g. 1:10 dilutions).
Run a 0.8 % TBE Agarose Gel with 200 ng dsDNA and lambda-Hind-III ladder as control.
If available run a Pulse Field Gel Electrophoresis with 200 ng dsDNA and a MidRange PFG Marker II ladder as control.
Nanodrop results:Qubit to Nanodrop ratio: 0.7.
0.8 % TBE Agarose Gel with different amount of DNA but all from the same extraction above.
Pulse Field Gel Electrophoresis:In order to determine the degeree of shearing of the DNA different vortexing times and pipetting times were tested: G1..original sample from extraction (maybe problems with the concentration here -->repeat the gel) v10.

As the amount of DNA between 24-48 kb seems to be increasing for bands 2-5, we think that with longer vortexing times more smaller and smaller fragments are produced.
For bands 6-9 we think that fragmets are also sheared through pipetting but that there is a certain cut off due to the pipette tip size and what length of fragmetns fits through
*pipette tips were cut.
