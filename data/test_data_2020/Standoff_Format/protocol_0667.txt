AutoCUT&RUN: genome-wide profiling of chromatin proteins in a 96 well format on a Biomek
Harvest fresh culture(s) at room temperature and count cells.
The AutoCUT&RUN protocol is recommended for 50,000 to 1,000,000 mammalian cells per sample.
Tissue samples can also be profiled using AutoCUT&RUN and should be processed either manually or enzymatically into a homogenous suspension of intact cells prior to binding Concanavalin A-coated beads.

Resuspend in 1.5 mL room temperature Wash Buffer by gently pipetting and transfer if necessary to a 2 mL tube.
Repeat steps 3 and 4 two more times.

While gently vortexing the cells at room temperature, add the Concanavalin A coated-bead suspension.
Place on tube nutator at room temperature for 5-10 min.
Mix well by vigorous inversion to ensure the bead-bound cells are in a homogenous suspension and divide into aliquots in 0.6-mL low-bind tubes, one for each antibody to be used.
Place on the magnet stand to clear and pull off and discard the liquid.
Place each tube at a low angle on the vortex mixer set to low (~1100 rpm) and squirt 150 µL of the Antibody Buffer per sample along the side while gently vortexing to allow the solution to dislodge most or all of the beads.

Pool indexed CUT&RUN libraries and perform paired-end Illumina sequencing following the manufacturer’s instructions.
We align paired-end reads using Bowtie2 version 2.2.5 with options: --local --very-sensitive-local --no-unal --no-mixed --no-discordant --phred33 -I 10 -X 700.
For mapping spike-in fragments, we also use the --no-overlap --no-dovetail options to avoid cross-mapping of the experimental genome to that of the spike-in DNA.
