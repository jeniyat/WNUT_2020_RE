Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC)
Müller-Hinton Agar and BrothPlate the agar on plates.
Streak the bacteria onto agar plates without inhibitor.
Incubate plates for 18-24h at 37ºC.
For each isolate, select three to five morphologically similar colonies from the agar plates and transfer them to a glass tube with 5ml MH-Broth.
Incubate for 18-24h at 37ºC.
Measure OD450 on cultures from step 4, and make dilutions in x mL MHB to OD450 = 0,01.
Use the setup shown in the following figure.
Pipette 50µl of MHB into column 2-11.
Add 100µl MBH into column 12.
Add 100µl of the antibiotic into column 1.
Withdraw 50µl from each well in column 1, add this to the corresponding wells in column 2.
Mix by pipetting up and down 4-6 times
(this makes column 2 a twofold dilution of column 1).
Repeat step 10 down to column 10 - discard the withdrawn solution from column 10.
Vortex the bacteria suspension from step 5.
Add 50µl of the suspension to each well in columns 1-11.
Cover the plates with film, make sure to create a tight seal to prevent any evaporation.
To exclude any errors repeat every plate setup three times (triplicates).
Incubate the plate at 37ºC for 16-24h.
Measure the growth by determinating OD450
Compare the data from the three triplicates, and exclude any deviations.
