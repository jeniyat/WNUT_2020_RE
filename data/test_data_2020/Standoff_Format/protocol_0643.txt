EMP 16S Illumina Amplicon Protocol
Amplify samples in triplicate, meaning each sample will be amplified in 3 replicate 25-µL PCR reactions.
Pool triplicate PCR reactions for each sample into a single volume (75 µL).
Run amplicons from each sample on an agarose gel.
Quantify amplicons with Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA Assay Kit (follow manufacturer’s instructions).
Combine an equal amount of amplicon from each sample (240 ng) into a single, sterile tube.
Higher amounts can be used if the final pool will be gel-isolated or when working with low-biomass samples.
Clean amplicon pool using MoBio UltraClean PCR Clean-Up Kit (follow manufacturer’s instructions).
Measure concentration and A260/A280 ratio of final pool that has been cleaned.
Send an aliquot for sequencing along with sequencing primers listed in Guidelines.
