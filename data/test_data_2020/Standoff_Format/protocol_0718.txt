Colony PCR (DreamTaq) with Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 and gel electrophoresis
Inoculate 50µl sterile water in a tube with your desired colony
It would be good if you use cell-material from a agar plate with an applied clone from an agar plate, so you have enough cell-material
The inoculated water should have a fresh, light green colour
Work under sterile conditions if you need your colonies on your agar plates for a further use.
Heat your samples up to 95 °C for 10 minutes
Make sure that you don't burn yourself! The samples are hot!.
Centrifuge your samples at 13,000 rpm for 1 minute.
Pipette 1-2µl of the supernatant into a fresh PCR tube
You can freeze the rest of your samples (including the pallet) at -20° C for a further use.
Afterwards just thaw your sample by room temperature and centifuge it at 13,000 rpm for 1 min.
Now you can pipette 1-2µl of the supernatant again for a later colony PCR.
Pipette your master mix.
In this case, we use the Dream Taq DNA Polymerase Kit from Thermo Fisher Science
Use the following contents for one sample:10x DreamTaq buffer: 2µldNTP Mix: 0.4µlForward primer: 2µlReverse primer: 2µlDreamTaq DNA Polymerase: 0.2µlWater (nuclease-free): 12.4µl (for 1µl template) or 12.3µl (for 2µl template)Total: 18-19µlPipette the Dream Taq DNA Polymerase in the end
You can also use the Thermo Fisher DreamTaq Master Mix, which contains the buffer, dNTP Mix and the Dream Taq Polymerase.
In this case, you just have to pipette The Master Mix,the forward primer, the reverse primer.
the template DNA and nuclease-free water.
Use the related protocol from your DreamTaq PCR package leaflet.
Pipette 18-19µl of your master mix to your template DNA, which contains 1-2µl (from the previous steps)
Run a PCR with your samples
Check the Tm of your primers to use the right annealing temperature.
The DreamTaq Polymerase uses the annealing temperature which is 5 °C lower than your Tm
Therefore I use a temperature that is 5 °C lower than my lowest primer Tm.
For example: My lowest Tm is 63 °C.
Therefore I use 58 °C as my annealing temperature
You can also check your optimal annealing temperature with various mathematical equations or the Thermo Fisher Tm calculator

In my case I use the following PCR protocol
1. Initial denaturation: 98° C - 2 min
2. Denaturation:  98° C - 30 sec.
3. Annealing: Tm - 5° C - 30 sec -> I use 58° C here
4. Extension: 72° C - 1 min.
5. Final extension: 72° C - 10 min
6. 4° C holdRerun the second to forth step for 35 times
Note from Thermo Fisher:The recommended extension step is 1 min.
for PCR products up to 2kb.
For longer products, the extension time should be prolonged by 1 min/kb.
Prepare an appropriate gel for gel electrophoresis
I prepare an 1%, small agarose gel.
Therefore put 0.5g of agarose in 50ml 1x TAE (TRIS-Acetat-EDTA) buffer
Afterwards heat it up in a microwave with 360 watt until the agarose is completely dissolved and the solution is clear
Cool it down at room temperature until it's hotter than lukewarm but still touchable and not burning your skin
Shake it some times while it's cooling down and check the solution for lump formation.
It should be clear!Add your dye to your agarosegel.I use midoriGreen Advance with an 1:20,0000 dilution factor
Therefore I pipette 2.5µl in my agarose gel solution
Afterwards pour your prepared agarose gel in a gel carrier
Don't forget to put your appropriate gel combs in your agarose gel before it hardens
When your gel is hardened, take out your gel combs and put appropriate buffer in the gel chamber until the agarose gel is completely soaked.
Load your samples with an appropriate loading dye.
I use the 6x loading dye of Thermo Fisher
Therefore I pipette 4µl to each sample.
Pipette your samples carefully up and down to mix your samples with the loading dye
Load your hardened agarosegel with your samples.
Adjust the loading volume to the size of your gel comb
Don't forget to use an appropriate ladder for your samples
I use the Gene Ruler 1kb Plus DNA ladder (ready to use) to detect a fragment of a size of 708 bp
Therefore I pipette 5µl of my ladder in one slot of the agarose gel.
Run your gel with your desired voltage.
I use 120 V
Adjust your running time to your fragment size
I run my gel until it reaches 2/3 of the gel.
Check your results with your imaging system
I use the ChemyDoc MP System of Bio-Rad to check my gel for my fragments
I use midoriGreen Advance to dye my fragments in the agarose gel
Therefore I use the Nucleic Acid Gels -> GelGreen channel in my Image Lab 5.0 software
Good luck!.
