Isolation of plasmid DNA from E. coli (Alkaline lysis method)
Buffer P1:            50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0; 10 mM EDTA; 100 mg/mL RNase A, (store at 4˚C)
Buffer P2:            0.2 M NaOH; 1 % (w/v) SDS
Buffer P3:            50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0; 10 mM EDTA; 100 mg/mL RNase A (store at 4˚C)
Buffer P2:            0.2 M NaOH; 1 % (w/v) SDS
Buffer P3:            0.2 M NaOH; 1 % (w/v) SDS            3 M Potassium acetate, pH 5.5.
Inoculate 5 mL LB, supplemented with appropriate antibiotics, using a single colony.
Grow over night at 37˚C.
Centrifuge culture at maximum speed and RT for 1 min.
Completely remove supernatant.
Resuspend in 350 µL buffer P1.
Add 350 µL buffer P2.
Gently mix by inverting (do not vortex!).
Incubate for up to 5 min at RT.
(Note: If incubated for too long, sheared genomic DNA fragments may contaminate the sample.).
Add 400 µL buffer P3.
Centrifuge for 10 minutes at RT and maximum speed.
Carefully transfer supernatant to a fresh tube, with as little contamination of pelletted material as possible.
If necessary, centrifuge the supernatant again (Step 7) to completely remove pellet.
Add 1 volume of isopropanol.
Incubate on ice for at least 2 minutes.
(Note: Incubation time can be increased to an hour, if required.).
Centrifuge sample for 5 minutes at RT and maximum speed.
Carefully remove supernatant without discarding the DNA pellet
Wash pellet by adding 500 µL of 70 % ethanol (do not resuspend).
Dry pellet in a thermoblock at 65 ˚C for 10 minutes.
Resuspend pellet in 50-100 µL pure water or buffer of choice (e.g. TE buffer)
Optional: Sample can be incubated at 65 ˚C to dissolve DNA more efficiently.
