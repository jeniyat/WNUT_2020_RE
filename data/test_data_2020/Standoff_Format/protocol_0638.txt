Dissection of mouse EDL and Soleus muscles
Pin the leg in a flexed position to the dissecting dish and cover it with Ringer solution.
For extraction of the Soleus, first, remove the skin of the leg.
Be sure to remove all surrounding fascia as well.
Hold the Achilles tendon with the forceps.
With the bodkin side of the scissors, carefully rub a gap open between the Achilles tendon and the other tendons.
When the gap is visible, cut the Achilles tendon as close as possible to the foot.
A gap should naturally start to open up.
Carefully help that gap to open up.
If surrounding fascia is still holding it together carefully cut it.
When the gap is open up to the knee the Soleus muscle is visible.
You can recognize it by it’s colour which is a darker pink.
Carefully cut the tendon as close as possible to the knee.
Gently hold the Soleus muscle on its upper tendon with the forceps and pull down very slowly and careful while (if needed) cutting all surrounding fascia that's still holding it.
After the whole muscle is freed from fascia make a cut at the lower tendon.
Separate the Soleus muscle from the leg and clean from all leftover fascia.
For easier handling, you can move the muscle to a new dissecting dish, pin the muscle as shown in the picture, cover with Ringer solution, and store at 4 °C.
For dissecting the EDL muscle, first, pin the leg into a stretched position.
Then remove all fascia.
Rub the tendons on the lower legs free
The 4 EDL tendon ends are next to the V-looking Tibialis tendon.
It can be checked if it’s the EDL’s by carefully lifting them up with the forceps.
While lifting the tendon ends the toes of the paw should stretch.
Cut the tendon ends as close as possible to the foot.
After the tendon ends are cut a ‘pocket’ naturally opens up.
A few surrounding fascias might still need to be removed.
Free the EDL muscle from the pocket till the upper tendon is visible.
Then cut the upper tendon.
Separate the EDL muscle from the leg and free from all fascia and fat.
Move both dissected muscles to a clean dissecting dish.
Pin muscles lightly stretched to the dish and cover with 3.7% PFA.
Cover the dish with parafilm and store at 4°C overnight.
