DNA extraction using the ammonium acetate technique
Add 50 µl of blood, 200 µl of a DNA extraction solution (which includes tris-HCL 30 mM ph 8, EDTA 10 mM, and 0,4% SDS), and 3 µl proteinase K.
Vortex and overnight at 56°.
Also incubate 70°C around three hours shaking frequently.
Add 200 µl AcNH4 4 M.
Vortex and incubate 30 minutes.
Shake every 10 minutes.
Centrifuge 15 minutes at 13000 rpm.
Move the supernatant to new tubes.
Add 800 µl of cold EtOH 100%.
Remove the supernatant.
Wash the pellet with 800 µl of EtOH 70%.
Centrifuge 5 minutes at 13000 rpm.
Remove the supernatant and dry.
Add 200 µl TE Buffer and leave 2-3 hours in the oven at 37°C.
