‘Frankenstein’ protocol for nuclei isolation from fresh and frozen tissue for snRNAseq
Mince/chop tissue with a razor blade to small pieces.
The tissue may be as small as a grain of rice.
Add  chilled Nuclei EZ Lysis Buffer to the tissue in 1.5 mL tube.
Homogenize the sample using a douncer (stroking 10-20 times).
Transfer the homogenate (~) into a 2 mL tube.
Add  of chilled Nuclei EZ Lysis Buffer, mix gently and incubate on ice for .
Gently mix with a wide bore tip.
Repeat 1-2 times during the incubation.
Filter homogenate using a 70 μm-strainer mesh.
Collect flow through in a polystyrene round-bottom FACS tube and transfer volume back into a new 2 mL tube.
Centrifuge the nuclei at  for  at  and remove supernatant leaving behind ~.
Gently resuspend nuclei in another  of EZ Lysis buffer, incubate for  on ice.
Centrifuge the nuclei at  for  at , remove supernatant as much as possible without disturbing pellet (if pellet looks loose leave ~ behind).
Add  Nuclei Wash and Resuspension Buffer and incubate  without resuspending to allow buffer interchange.
After incubation, add  of Nuclei Wash and Resuspension Buffer and resuspend the nuclei.
Centrifuge the nuclei at  for  at , remove supernatant leaving behind ~.
Gently resuspend nuclei in  Nuclei Wash and Resuspension Buffer and transfer to a 1.5 mL tube (easier to see small pellets).
Repeat Step 13 and resuspend in  Nuclei Wash and Resuspension Buffer supplemented with DAPI.
Collect all nuclei by washing off nuclei from the wall of centrifuge tube
Filter nuclei (at least once) with a 35-µm cell strainer.
Visually inspect nuclei integrity under a microscope.
Perform cytometric analysis.
Identify single nuclei and sub-populations based on DNA content, gate and sort directly into 10x RT Buffer prepared without the RT Enzyme Mix.
Proceed immediately with the 10x Genomics Single Cell Protocol and minimize the time between nuclei preparation/sorting and chip loading.
Add  RT Enzyme Mix to the sorted nuclei in RT buffer, mix well but gently and load chip as per the  Single Cell 3' Reagents User Guide or Single Cell V(D)J 5' Reagents User Guide.
