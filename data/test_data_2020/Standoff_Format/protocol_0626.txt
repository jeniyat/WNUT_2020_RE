Determine the size distribution and concentration of libraries by capillary electrophoresis using an Agilent 4200 TapeStation with D1000 reagents or equivalent.
Mix barcoded libraries to achieve equal representation as desired aiming for a final concentration as recommended by the manufacturer.
After mixing, perform an Ampure bead cleanup if needed to remove any residual PCR primers.
Perform paired-end Illumina sequencing on the barcoded libraries following the manufacturer’s instructions.
We align paired-end reads using Bowtie2 version 2.2.5 with options: --local --very-sensitive-local --no-unal --no-mixed --no-discordant --phred33 -I 10 -X 700.
For mapping E. coli carry-over fragments, we also use the --no-overlap --no-dovetail options to avoid possible cross-mapping of the experimental genome to that of the carry-over E. coli DNA that is used for calibration.
