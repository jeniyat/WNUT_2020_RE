DPPH radical scavenging capacity measurement
Extractions were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to obtain a stock solution (10 mg/mL) for antioxidant assays.
DPPH radical solution were prepared for 120μM with 95% ethanol.
The extracts were prepared by two times dilution method in 96-well microtitre plates.
An aliquot of extract (10 μL) were mixed to 195 μL of enthanolic DPPH in 96-well microtitre plates.
The reaction mixtures were incubated at room temperature for 30 min in the dark.
Absorbance was measured at 517 nm by Microplate Reader.
The free radical scavenging activity was calculated as follows:%RSA= [(Ablank − Asample / Ablank] 100%
Where: Ablank was the absorbance of without samples, and Asample was the absorbance of the test sample.
The values are expressed as the means of triplicate analyses.
