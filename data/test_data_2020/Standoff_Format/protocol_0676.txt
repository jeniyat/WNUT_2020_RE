Phage Buffer
Prepare 5M NaCl by dissolving 29.22g NaCl in 100ml Milli Q water and 0.2um filter solution into sterile container.
Prepare 1M Tris-Cl, pH7.4, by dissolving 7.882g Tris-HCl in 90ml Milli Q water, adjusting pH to 7.4 with 1N NaOH, bringing final volume to 50ml and filter sterilizing through a 0.2um filter into a sterile container.
Prepare 1M MgSO4 by dissolving 12.3g MgSO4-7H2O in 50ml Milli Q water and filter sterilize through 0.2um filter into sterile container.
Mix together 3.0ml 5M NaCl, 4.0ml 1M Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, and 1.0ml 1M MgSO4 in 92ml sterile Milli Q water in a sterile container.
Filter solution through a 0.02um Anotop syringe filter into a sterile container.
Final phage buffer will be 150mM NaCl, 40mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 10mM MgSO4.
