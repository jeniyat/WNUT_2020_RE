CUT&RUN with Drosophila tissues
Prepare a fresh 5% digitonin solution as follows:Weigh out 50 mg digitonin powder in a 2 ml microcentrifuge tube.
Boil some water in a small beaker in a microwave oven, and pipette in and out to warm the 1000 μL pipette tip.
Pipette the hot water into the tube with the digitonin powder, close the cap, and quickly vortex on full until the digitonin is completely dissolved.
If refrigerated, this stock can be used within a week, but will need reheating as the digitonin slowly precipitates.
The effectiveness of digitonin varies between batches, so testing permeability of Trypan blue is recommended to determine effective concentrations.
We have obtained excellent results with 0.02-0.1% digitonin.

This section includes DNA recovery from both supernatant and pellet fractions.
In initial experiments with a new antibody, we compare the abundance of cleaved DNA in supernatant and pellet fractions to confirm that most of the cleaved DNA is soluble.
in most cases this is the case, and then library construction and sequencing is performed only with supernatant DNA
The following steps describe DNA recovery from both supernatant and pellet fractions.
Chromatin fractionation: Grab beads on magnet, 2’.
Transfer the supernatant containing cleaved chromatin particles to a new tube, marked ‘sample#S’.
Resuspend pellet in 150 µL Pellet buffer, add a ‘P’ to the tube label.
The 'P' tube is a transient tube.
Add 2 µL 10% SDS and 2.5 µL of 20 mg /mL Proteinase K to each ‘S’ sample and mix by brief vortexing.
Incubate ‘S’ and ‘P’ samples in a 50˚C water bath, 2 hr.
To ‘S’ tubes: Use wide-bore green tips to add 40 µL AmpureXP bead slurry and 560 µL MXP buffer to each tube, mix thoroughly by 10X pipetting.
Incubate 15’ RT.
This is a non-size-selective recovery of DNA fragments; the PEG:sample ratio is 2V.
Total volume is ~900 µL.
To ‘P’ tubes: grab ConA beads with magnet, 2’.
Transfer supernatant to a new tube.
Beads are very slippery in this buffer.
Use wide-bore green tips to add 40 µL AmpureXP bead slurry and 65 µL HXP buffer to each tube, mix thoroughly by 10X pipetting.
Incubate 15’ RT
This is a size-selective recovery of DNA; the PEG:sample ratio is 0.7V.Total volume is ~255 µL.
The fragments you are looking for will be in the supernatant!.
To ‘P’ samples: grab Ampure beads with magnet, 5’.
Transfer supernatant to a new tube, tag-labeled as ‘sample#PX’.
Add 40 µL AmpureXP bead slurry and 155 µL MXP buffer to each tube, mix thoroughly by 10X pipetting.
This is a non-size-selective recovery of DNA; the PEG:sample ratio is 2V.
Total volume is ~450 µL.
24) To ‘S’ and ‘PX’ tubes: grab Ampure beads with magnet, 5’.
Pipette off buffer, making sure not to remove beads at the end.
Keep tubes on the magnet, and add 1 mL 80% ethanol to each tube.
Incubate 30”.
Beads stick very well in this step.
Aspirate off ethanol and replace with 1 mL 80% ethanol.
Slowly aspirate to remove all traces of ethanol.
Leave tubes on magnet and allow beads to air-dry, 15’.
Resuspend beads in 40 µL 10 mM Tris pH8.
Determine the size distribution of DNA in samples by Agilent 4200 TapeStation analysis
The positive control (anti-H3K27me3) should show a nucleosomal ladder in the 'S' sample, and a weak high-molecular weight DNA band in the 'PX' sample
The negative control (non-specific rabbit IgG) should show no DNA in the 'S' sample, and a weak high-molecular weight DNA band in the 'PX' sample
Most antibodies (eg to transcription factors) will show no nucleosomal ladder, but we find that they often have sufficient material for library construction and produce excellent genomic profile
