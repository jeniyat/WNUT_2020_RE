Aichivirus 3C3D RT-PCR
Prepare sufficient for number of reaction plus a 'dead volume', usually 2 extra. 
Adjust as necessary if using a robotic dispenser.
Dispense 15µL to each reaction well. 
Add 5µL of template, extracted RNA, controls or NTC (nuclease-free water).
Total reaction volume is 20µL
The assay has been used with Eppendorf thermocyclers.
PCR cycling times
Amplified products are analysed by gel electrophoresis or equipment such as a QIAxcel.
For gel electrophoresis, a 1.5% agarose gel with ethidium bromide was made using the following recipe.
Boil in microwave for 1.5 -2 minutes until agarose powder is dissolved.
Add 2 drops of ethidium bromide (0.625mg/ml) and mix before pouring warm into the gel form with a comb.
Leave for approx 30minutes at room temperature to set.
Place gel (on a tray) into the tank and cover with 0.5X TBE with ethidium bromide.
Mix 2μl of loading dye with10µl of amplified product and add to a well in the gel.
Mix 2μl of loading dye with 5μl of 100bp marker and add to a well in the gel.
Ideally, the first and last lane but this is not essential.
Run the gel for 60-90 minutes at 80 volts or until the bands on the marker have separated adequately without run off the end of the gel.
