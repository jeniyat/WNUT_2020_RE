Taxonomic biomarker discovery with LEfSe
Before beginning, we need to convert the sample names into consistent class names.
This can easily be done by manually editing the {"blocks":[{"key":"630rg","text":"output\/merged_abundance_table.txt","type":"unstyled","depth":0,"inlineStyleRanges":[],"entityRanges":[],"data":[]}],"entityMap":[]} generated in the previous protocols or using the following "sed" based Unix command:.
The first LEfSe step consists of formatting the input table, making sure the class information is in the first row and scaling the values in [0,1M] which is useful for numerical computational reasons.
Now, the LEfSe biomarker discovery tool can be used with default statistical options.
Here we change one default parameter to increase the threshold on the LDA effect size from 2 (default) to 4.
The results of the operation can now be displayed plotting the resulting list of biomarkers with corresponding effect sizes.
The resulting image ({"blocks":[{"key":"975lt","text":"output_images\/lefse_biomarkers.png","type":"unstyled","depth":0,"inlineStyleRanges":[],"entityRanges":[],"data":[]}],"entityMap":[]}) is shown below:.
Another complementary visualization focuses on showing the biomarkers on the underlying taxonomic tree.
The default plotting output is shown here:.
Single features can also be plotted as barplots with {"blocks":[{"key":"25aim","text":"plot_features.py","type":"unstyled","depth":0,"inlineStyleRanges":[],"entityRanges":[],"data":[]}],"entityMap":[]}.
For example, to plot the distribution of abundances for Firmicutes the command is:.
All features (or all biomarkers) can also be exported in one compressed archive:.
Here are the resulting figures for Firmicutes and for Veillonellaceae (extracted from biomarkers.zip).
