NeuN Immunohistochemistry Protocol
To remove the excess paraformaldehyde fixative, wash with 0,1 M PBS the sections free-floating at agitation in room temperature for 3 min.
(1/3).
(2/3).
(3/3).
Incubate with 12% Boric acid (pH =9,0, 70°C) in a water bath for 1 hour.
Remove the recipients from water bath and wait until it is at room temperature.
Wash the sections with 0,1% PBS/T for 5 minutes.
Wash the sections with 0,1M PBS for 2 minutes (shaking).
Incubate with blocking buffer (Normal Goat Serum Blocking Solution S-1000 10% in 0,3% PBST ) for 12 hours at gentle agitation in refrigeration 4°C.
Remove the serum and incubate with Anti NeuN Antibody (MAB377 Anti-NeuN Antibody, clone A60), diluted in 0,3%PBS/T at gentle agitation, overnight at 4°C.
Wash the sections with 0,1M PBS/T 0,1% for 2 minutes (shaking).
Incubate with secondary antibody (Biotinylated Goat Anti-Mouse IgG Antibody, BA-9200, Vector Laboratories ) diluted in 0,3% PBS/T at 1:250, for 1 hour at room temperature.
Incubate with 0,3% hydrogen peroxide (diluted in 0,1 M PBS) for 15 minutes with light shaking.
Wash sections with PBS/T 0,1% for 2 minutes (shaking).(1/3).
Wash sections with PBS/T 0,1% for 2 minutes (shaking).(2/3).
Wash sections with PBS/T 0,1% for 2 minutes (shaking).(3/3).
Incubate in VECTASTAIN® ABC KIT solution for 1 hour (total) at 4ºC with light shaking
First 37,5 µl A + 37,5µl B with 1,88 ml 0,3%PBS/T for 30 minutes.
Add 13,12 ml 0,3%PBS/T and incubate for 30 more minutes at 4ºC with light shaking
Wash with 0,1% PBS /T for 5 minutes, (shaking).
(1/2).
(2/2).
Firstly prepare the Solution A by mix 0,006g of Diaminobenzidine (DAB) with 5 ml of distilled water.
Secondly, prepare the Solution B by mixing 0,250g of Nickel ammonium sulfate with 5 ml de Acetate Buffer pH 6.0.
Thirdly mix Solution A and B adding ammonium chloride (0,004g) with 0.020g α-D-Glucose.
Leave the section in this mix of A and B for 5 minutes.
Incubate sections with solution GND and wait for 3 minutes.
Add 0,007g of Glucose-oxidase for each 3ml of GND solution for revelation.
Stop revelation when the goal contrast is achieved (use a low gain microscope).
Remove the GDN + Glucose oxidase and wash the sections using 0,1M PBS for 2 minutes with light shaking.
Mount the sections in appropriate gelatinized microscope slides and dry at room temperature for 12 hours or more depending on the mounting medium of choice.
Dihydrate and add the coverslips.
