Nuclei isolation from human kidney for single-nucleus RNA-seq
Precool all instruments and buffers.
Start with kidney cubes (either fresh or snap frozen, smaller than 8 mm3) and place on a 60 mm dish.
Add 1 ml of NLB1, then mince very well with a fresh razor blade.
Transfer the minced tissue with NLB1 into a Dounce tissue grinder and add another 1 ml of NLB1.
Grind 20-30 times with a loose pestle, then pass the homogenate through a 200 µm strainer and collect in a 50 ml conical tube.
Transfer the homogenate again into a Dounce tissue grinder.
Grind the homogenate 10-15 times with a tight pestle.
Add 2 ml of NLB1 and incubate for 5 min on ice.
Pass the homogenate through a 40 µm strainer into 50 ml conical tube.
Transfer the homogenate into a 15 ml conical tube.
Centrifuge the tube at 500 G for 5 min at 4°C.
Discard supernatant.
Carefully suspend the pellet in 4 ml of NLB2.
Incubate on ice for 5 min.
Centrifuge at 500 G for 5 min at 4°C.
Carefully suspend the pellet in 2 ml of NSB.
Pass the suspension through a 5 µm strainer into 50 ml conical tube.
Count nuclei by hemocytometer.
