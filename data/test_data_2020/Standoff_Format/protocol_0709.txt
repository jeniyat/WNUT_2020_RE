LB (Luria-Bertani) agar
Add 25g LB broth, Miller and 15g agar (or 40g LB agar, Miller) per litre of water.
Mix well by inverting bottle several times until powder dissolved.
Sterilize by autoclaving for 20 min at 15 psi (1.05 kg/cm2) on liquid cycle.
Following autoclave (while media still liquid but cool enough to safely handle bottle) pour LB agar from bottle into plates within a laminar flow hood.
Allow ~50 mL per plate.
Leave plates in laminar hood until agar sets (~30 mins).
When agar has set, replace lid, invert plates and store in an air tight bag at 4 °C.
Plates should be removed from 4 °C at least 1 h before use and placed in 30 °C incubator.
To prevent condensation from lid dropping onto agar surface, wipe lids dry with Kimwipe and store plates inverted.
