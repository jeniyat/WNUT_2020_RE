Perform all steps until microscope analysis in a Biosafety Class II Cabinet: Seed RAW264.7 macrophage cells at 5x104 cells/well in a 12 well plate onto 18mm diameter glass coverslips (500µL cells per well supplemented with 1mL of fresh complete macrophage media).
Plate cells out the day before phagocytosis experiment.
Seed 4 wells per cell type (including the control).
Incubate overnight in a 37oC/5% CO2 incubator.
Grow up overnight cultures of bacteria (GFP labelled E. coli) day before phagocytosis experiment.
100µL stock in 100mL Luria Broth with appropriate selection antibiotics.
Grow at 37oC in a shaking incubator to an OD600 of 1 (~108 cells/mL).
Three hours before planned macrophage inoculation, sub-culture overnight bacterial culture to ensure bacteria are in early log-phase (1mL overnight culture + 9mL fresh Ab free LB).
Induce cultures with 10% arabinose/100mM IPTG (~200µL/10mL bacterial culture) at 37oC in a shaking incubator.
Spin down bacterial culture for 5 minutes at 13,000g to pellet cells.
Resuspend in appropriate amount of 1x PBS (dependent on required final concentration of bacteria + amount required for assay).
Remove macrophage media from the wells and replace with fresh media (500µL).
Supplement GFP E. coli at a ratio of 10 cells/macrophage (~106 cells/mL, add 1mL).
Don't add bacteria to control wells.
Co-incubate cells for 1/8/24/48 hours (or other time intervals) at 37oC/5% CO2 to allow for bacterial uptake.
Stop phagocytosis by adding 550µL ice-cold PBS to the well
Aspirate supernatant using a pipette and then wash the cells three times with cold PBS (1mL/wash).
Transfer coverslips to a microscope slide with a drop of PBS (~6µL) using tweezers.
Ensure the side with the macrophages attached is face down on the microscope slide.
Seal microscope slides using clear nail polish and allow to dry.
Analyse cells using an upright fluorescent microscope to determine if the macrophages have phagocytosed the bacteria.
Image 15 macrophages per coverslip x 4 replicates = 60 macrophages in total per treatment per time point.
Parameters to investigate:1) Percentage of macrophages containing bacteria 2) Average number of intracellular bacteria per macrophagePossible other parameters:1) Percentage of macrophages with attached bacteria2) Average number of attached bacteria per macrophage.
