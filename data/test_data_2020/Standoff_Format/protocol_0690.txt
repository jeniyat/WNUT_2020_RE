Mu-DNA: a modular universal DNA extraction method adaptable for a wide range of sample types
The entire protocol is scalable depending on initial sample weight or transferred lysate amount.
Where relevant, scalable volumes are shown in brackets next to reagent volumes used, e.g. (2 X volume).
Large sample weights increase volumes at each step and will require extended centrifuge times under lower xg to obtain optimal results
Important: Incubate Soil Lysis Additive and Binding Solution at 55°C until required.
If any precipitate is present mix gently until redissolved.
Use solutions while still warm
