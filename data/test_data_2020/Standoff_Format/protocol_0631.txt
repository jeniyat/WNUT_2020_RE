Trans-Blot® Turbo™ Transfer with Home-made buffers
Anode buffer I 0,3 M Tris pH 10,4; 10% Methanol Anode buffer II 25 mM Tris pH 10,4; 10% Methanol Cathode Buffer 25 mM Tris, 40 mM 6-Amino-n-Caproic acid, 10% Methanol, final pH 9,4.
We use mini-protean gels (Bio-Rad).
Our PVDF (0,22µm) membranes are 8,7 mm x 6,2 mm.
The paper should have similar dimensions
Paper used: Kimberly Clark , WYPALL X60 (KC 6034).
After methanol exposure, the PVDF membrane looks "wet".
You will see that the membrane retains its highly hidrophobic properties when you transfer it to the Anode I solution.
Make sure that to immerse the membrane so long until it does not float on the surface of the buffer.
It should remain submerged.
See picture attached for the order of the paper in the stack.
Each line shown for paper, represent a single paper.
If you have doubts, measure the thickness of 2 single layer.
It should be 1 mm approx.
We use the following times and conditions for the Turbo Blot transfer machine from Bio-Rad.20 minutes at 1.3 A, Max.
25V for one mini-gel transfer20 minutes at 2.5 A - Max.
25V for two minigels transfer.
Open up the cassette with the  stack and remove carefully the membrane.
Place the membrane to dry for 1h at 37°C to bind the proteins to the membrane.
Store at 4°C for up to 2 weeks, and at -70°C for up to 6 months
Avoid rubbing the surface of the membrane with the bound proteins.
I am attaching pictures of our system to give some spatial orientation for those of you who have not used this system yet and some components you will need.
