Resazurin viability assay for human primary T cells in 96-well format
Add 10X dye for each well using a multichannel pipettor (so, for 200 ul you will be adding 20 ul of the 10X solution).
Continue culturing the cells the same way for 24 hours.
Use a plate reader to measure the absorbance at both 570 nm and 595 nm.
Subtract your 595 nm measurement from the 570 nm for each well.
Then (optionally) subtract your blank media measurement from your treatment measurements.
The number you end up is directly proportional to the number of cells in the well.
