Extraction of genomic DNA using "Edwards" buffer
Grind tissue (fresh or frozen entire seedlings, 0.5-1 rosette of cauline leaves, inflorescence) in microfuge tube with autoclaved plastic pestle for 10-15 seconds.
Add 400 µl Edwards buffer.
Grind briefly to remove any remaining  tissue from pestle.
Vortex 5 seconds.
The preps can be kept at room temperature (RT) until all preps are ready (up to ~20).
Centrifuge 5 minutes in tabletop centrifuge at full speed (13.000 rpm).
Transfer 300 µl supernatant into a fresh microfuge tube
Add 300 µl isopropanol and mix
Leave for 2 minutes at RT.
Centrifuge 10 minutes at RT.
Decant off and discard all supernatant into S1-waste.
Wash pellet with 700 µl 70 % EtOH, then centrifuge for 5 minutes at full speed and discard EtOH.
Air dry DNA pellet at 37°C.
Resuspend pellet in 40 µl of sterile ddH2O (incubate at 37°C if necessary).
